# Architecture

## Direct Codex mode

The named-agent hub (`npm run bridge`) owns one Socket Mode connection and one
App Server client per explicitly registered agent. `agents.json` selects the
workspace, private channels and authorized users. `AgentHub` maps explicit bot
mentions and persisted Slack reply roots to exact Codex task IDs. An owner may
share prompt access with another configured user; approvals remain owner-only.
New agents use read-only sandboxing with on-request approvals. No channel
history is fetched for prompts. See [agent hub](docs/agent-hub.md).

`src/direct/` is the TypeScript, single-agent entry point. Slack Socket Mode
talks directly to Codex App Server through stdio JSON-RPC. The binding selects
one task, channel, and owner. Native turn IDs replace terminal/PID observations
for message delivery and interruption. No global task enumeration, transcript
parsing, or history migration occurs. It inherits native task policy and
refuses an existing writer lock. See [Direct Codex](docs/direct-codex.md).

The remaining architecture describes the legacy terminal-based daemon.

Slack Agent Bridge currently runs as one macOS daemon connecting one trusted
Slack owner to local Claude Code and Codex sessions. Providers have
separate adapters and native conversation identities; Slack, state, tmux,
terminal viewports, artifacts, and lifecycle coordination are shared.

The accepted multi-node direction separates the sole Slack-facing coordinator
from enrolled execution nodes without changing `/sab-*`. The current runtime is
the compatible all-in-one deployment: its execution node is implicitly
`local`. An authenticated node listener is available only when explicitly
configured, and enrolled nodes cannot receive provider work yet. See
[Multi-node coordinator architecture](docs/multi-node-architecture.md).

The daemon is the sole owner of the Slack Socket Mode token. Never run two
daemon processes against the same Slack app: Slack events will race between
them.

## Components

- `bin/sab` is the only public local executable. It dispatches `new`,
  `terminal`, `account`, `upload`, `team`, `automation`, and `node`. Its private `__run`
  subcommand is used only inside tmux.
- `scripts/run-session.sh` is the provider runner. A local `sab new` creates and
  attaches to tmux; daemon-created sessions start tmux detached. It configures
  the Claude MCP Channel, Codex event proxy/fallback, before
  executing the provider CLI.
- `daemon/daemon.mjs` owns Slack ingress/egress, hooks, state adoption,
  session/channel correlation, resurrection, settings, permission decisions,
  switching, App Home publishing, and provider coordination.
- `daemon/management-ui.mjs` and `daemon/app-home.mjs` build bounded, pure
  Block Kit surfaces. The daemon remains responsible for authorization,
  provider catalogs, command dispatch, and every side effect.
- `daemon/slack-runtime.mjs` constructs the sole direct Slack API and Socket Mode
  clients for the compatible all-in-one deployment. `daemon/coordinator.mjs`
  owns prompt acknowledgement and serialized startup of that sole ingress;
  future node routing happens behind this boundary rather than opening another
  Socket Mode connection.
- `daemon/providers.mjs` is the provider boundary: labels, command parsing,
  provider-specific flag allowlists, defaults, resume arguments, model/effort
  validation, and update behavior.
- `channel/server.mjs` implements the Claude Channels path. Claude hooks provide
  lifecycle and stable transcript/status integration.
- `scripts/codex-event-proxy.mjs` transparently forwards the loopback App Server
  WebSocket to the Codex TUI while extracting completed semantic commentary,
  a completed-turn final fallback, and the root `thread/started` identity used
  only to bootstrap an exact pending automation. Accepted stable events are
  serialized in App Server source order before entering the daemon, preventing
  a delayed earlier delivery from being overtaken and rejected as stale. Codex
  hooks remain authoritative for native identity and permissions; Stop and the
  exact App Server turn share one durable final-delivery claim.

- `daemon/terminal-control.mjs` resolves authoritative active sessions and
  serializes terminal operations per tmux name. `daemon/terminal-http.mjs` and
  `scripts/sab-terminal.mjs` expose the same operations to local scripts.
- `daemon/teams.mjs` defines the bounded channel-level team and task journal.
  `daemon/team-auth.mjs` is the exact caller-identity gate;
  `daemon/team-files.mjs` owns workspace-contained private file staging; and
  `daemon/team-http.mjs` plus `scripts/sab-team.mjs` expose the loopback-only,
  JSON-safe agent mailbox. Slack membership administration, provider-turn
  reporting, and explicit task release remain in the sole daemon.
- `daemon/nodes.mjs` defines compatibility-safe execution-node identity and
  exact channel/session/node binding. `daemon/execution-nodes.mjs` is the
  execution boundary; the first adapter wraps existing local spawn and terminal
  primitives without changing runtime behavior.
- `daemon/node-registry.mjs` defines the implicit local node, pinned Ed25519
  enrollment records, node-scoped operators, defaults, revocation, and safe
  human-name resolution. `daemon/node-protocol.mjs` validates the bounded
  versioned control envelopes and operation/event allowlists.
- `daemon/node-auth.mjs`, `daemon/node-enrollment.mjs`, and
  `daemon/node-keys.mjs` implement one-use hashed invitations, node-local
  Ed25519 identity, short-lived signed challenges, and coordinator identity
  pinning. `daemon/node-transport.mjs` adds bounded authenticated WebSockets,
  persisted connection epochs, stale-connection fencing, heartbeats, and
  revocation. `daemon/node-runtime.mjs` keeps that listener off by default and
  requires TLS plus an explicit public WSS URL for non-loopback binds.
- `daemon/node-http.mjs`, `daemon/node-management.mjs`, and
  `scripts/sab-node.mjs` expose loopback-only administrator enrollment controls
  through `sab node`. The invitation secret is accepted by the node CLI only
  through a private file or stdin and is never stored in plaintext.
- `scripts/sab-upload.mjs`, `scripts/sab-automation.mjs`, and
  `scripts/sab-account.sh` are private implementations reached through `sab`.

## Session identity and durable state

`state.sessions[nativeSessionId]` stores the native provider identity, cwd,
provider, pid, tmux name, channel, flags, model, effort, and provider-specific
metadata. A missing `provider` is deliberately interpreted as Claude so old
state remains resumable without a bulk migration.

`state.channels[channelId]` is the authoritative active mapping. The mapped
session must point back to the same immutable channel ID. A channel name may be
changed freely in Slack and is never an identity key.

Session teams are created lazily. `state.teams[teamId]` binds one coordinator
and bounded workers by immutable channel ID with presentation aliases and
per-worker file permission. `state.teamTasks[taskId]` is the bounded,
immediately persisted delivery journal: request/payload digest, exact source and
target channel/session/provider/node identities, dispatch phase, Slack audit
timestamps, the bounded original instruction, replies, coordinator messages,
stable result/error/warning, lifecycle versions, and expiry. The mutable delivery
envelope is removed after provider acceptance, while the instruction remains for
bounded inbox observability. Team membership survives provider switching
because every send/reply revalidates the channel's current active leg.

A missing `session.nodeId` and missing `state.channelNodes[channelId]` resolve to
the implicit local node. Explicit remote metadata must agree on both records;
an invalid, unknown, or mismatched route has no authority and cannot fall back
to local execution. This preserves old state without a bulk migration.

A switched channel may own one Claude and one Codex native leg through
lineage state. Exactly one leg is active. Standby legs preserve resumable IDs
and settings but have no channel authority or live provider process.

State writes are atomic. Replacement and restart paths fence stale hooks by
native ID, provider, process ancestry, tmux claim, channel mapping, and lineage
phase. An old process may not overwrite or mark dormant the session that
superseded it.

## Process and terminal lifecycle

tmux, not Ghostty, owns the interactive process lifetime:

1. The daemon validates cwd and flags.
2. The execution-node router selects the implicit local adapter, which calls
   `spawnSession` to create a named detached tmux session running
   `sab __run <provider>`.
3. A provider-native start event claims that tmux and binds or adopts the
   session/channel state.
4. Slack messages use the provider's inbound transport or a bounded tmux paste.
5. The provider may run indefinitely with zero attached terminal clients.

Ghostty is an optional viewport. Opening a viewport checks that the exact tmux
and provider are still alive. If a client is already attached, the bridge finds
that Ghostty process through the tmux client ancestry and focuses it. Otherwise
it starts one Ghostty process whose only job is `tmux attach-session`.

Closing a viewport calls `tmux detach-client`; it does not send input, kill
tmux, change session state, or stop the provider. `open-all` and `close-all`
derive their targets only from valid `state.channels` mappings and exclude
standby, provisional, stale, and rebound records. Operations on the same tmux
name are serialized.

A dormant native session is different from a closed terminal. If its provider
process is gone, an owner Slack message runs the provider-native resume form in
a new detached tmux session and queues the message until the start event safely
rebinds it. No terminal needs to be visible.

Claude resurrection requires its exact `SessionStart` PID/tmux claim. A tmux
that appears briefly and exits is startup failure, not readiness: SAB records
only its bounded numeric exit status, retries once with a fresh tmux identity,
then clears the failed input reservation and stale viewport binding and reports
an actionable Slack error. The queued owner message is retained for an explicit
later retry; terminal output is never copied into the diagnostic file.

Codex has one bounded lifecycle exception: an idle `codex resume` may expose a
ready TUI without emitting `SessionStart`. Every resurrection path first allows
the native hook to claim the replacement. If it remains absent, the bridge
walks only the exact replacement tmux's descendant process tree, prefers its
Codex App Server identity, repeats the tmux ancestry and channel-authority
checks, and then performs the same durable PID/channel completion before the
wake may report success. A racing native hook and this fallback share one
tmux-keyed completion claim, so announcements and queued prompts remain exactly
once. Boot recovery applies the same fail-closed correlation to an interrupted
hookless resume; it never searches for or adopts an unrelated Codex process.

`/sab-update all` derives its candidates from the same exact authoritative
channel/session mapping. Before each stop it revalidates the PID, tmux, and
authority and rejects active turns, question forms, permission decisions,
provider transitions, private maintenance turns,
automation ownership, delegated team work, and concurrent wake/restart work. Eligible sessions are
grouped by provider: all selected sessions in a group stop, that provider's CLI
updates once, and every stopped session resumes even when the update check
fails. Each exact native session is reserved synchronously before the first
Slack notice or other await; duplicate updates are rejected and incoming prompts
during this bounded relaunch are held in the existing per-session queue. A
verified in-place native identity replacement carries that queue and both
maintenance fences to the new identity. Any one-use artifact grants already
embedded in queued prompts follow only that exact provider/channel replacement.
Replacement startup keeps direct input closed while Slack metadata is refreshed.
One ordered drain is the sole queue consumer: provider launch arguments and
Claude stream attachment cannot remove or reorder prompts. It remains active
until every queued prompt, including prompts arriving during the drain, reaches
the exact replacement input surface. Drain ownership follows the stable session
record across native identity replacement, so competing lifecycle
callbacks cannot start consumers under the old and new ids. A failed delivery restores the undelivered tail; a failed wake
or metadata setup releases only the exact opaque fence generation acquired by
that startup. Native identity replacement carries that ownership forward, and
a delayed failure cannot clear a newer restart's fence. This releases only the
stale maintenance marker so an explicit update or later message can retry the
dormant session. A stale
reservation still cannot stop or resume an unrelated replacement. Standby,
provisional, stale, dormant, and rebound records are never bulk-restarted.

The only exception is a provider-local trust surface that cannot be decided
remotely. The bridge opens the provisional target's terminal automatically and
reports the required local action in Slack.

## Slack command routing

The canonical manifest exposes one namespace:

```text
/sab-new  /sab-model  /sab-effort  /sab-flags  /sab-update
/sab-stop /sab-switch /sab-kill    /sab-status /sab-usage
/sab-team /sab-health /sab-cleanup /sab-claim /sab-help
```

`/sab-new` requires an explicit provider: its no-argument panel does not choose
one until the owner clicks a provider. In a session channel, the authoritative
session selects provider-specific behavior for every other provider operation.
From the control channel, `/sab-status` and `/sab-usage` may take a provider
filter. `/sab-update all` is bridge-wide and may be run from the control channel
rejects non-Claude sessions before mutation.

No-argument management commands use Block Kit as a presentation layer over the
same dispatcher. `/sab-status` renders a session or bridge dashboard; model and
effort selectors come from the authoritative provider adapter. Every action
carries the exact session identity that rendered it and revalidates the owner,
immutable channel mapping, current native leg, provider catalog, transition,
delegated-work state, and the ordinary command's safety gates before mutation.
The rendered identity remains immutable across asynchronous lookups even when a
native `/clear` rebrands the in-memory session object. Team actions also carry
the exact team ID so controls from a closed team cannot mutate its replacement.
Stale controls fail visibly. Broad update and team-close actions require Slack
confirmation. An exact
session reserved for provider maintenance rejects overlapping
lifecycle/settings changes until it resumes. Claude picker entries carry exact
provider model IDs so standard and 1M-context siblings cannot collapse through
the textual alias preference.
Account, flag, and restart-based Codex setting changes acquire that reservation
before their first Slack call; owner input then queues ahead of question-form
routing for the replacement process. Status reanchors and their provisional
cleanup retain the immutable channel captured when the bump began. Slack Option
values preserve valid identities up to 150 characters and omit longer values
instead of truncating them.
Explicit text forms remain available; `/sab-update current`
directly updates the current session while no-argument `/sab-update` opens its
chooser.

App Home is another view over that dispatcher. The canonical manifest enables
the Home tab and sends `app_home_opened` through the existing Socket Mode
connection. The owner receives fresh bridge/session state; other users receive
no session metadata or actions. Home navigation has no durable state, model and
effort options are refreshed from the provider adapters, and the new-session
modal rechecks the chosen top-level project plus every provider flag. Lifecycle
results remain in the normal control/session channels. This needs one manifest
reinstall on the existing app, but no additional OAuth scope, token, callback
URL, process, or app.

The parser accepts old provider-prefixed slash commands only as an unadvertised
upgrade shim while the owner replaces a 1.x manifest. No old command appears in
the canonical manifest, help, or public launcher surface.

## Session teams

`/sab-team` is owner-only administration over a provider-neutral, local-node
collaboration graph. Team creation makes the current authoritative private SAB
channel the coordinator. The Block Kit picker accepts only another exact
authoritative private SAB channel. Membership and permission changes are
persisted before acknowledgement and reported in affected channels. The first
topology is a star: coordinator-to-worker tasks and worker-to-coordinator
replies/status/finals. Worker mesh is absent; files are denied until explicitly
enabled for that worker.

The agent surface is `sab team`, never Slack Web API access. Its loopback request
derives the source from process ancestry and requires exact PID, tmux, provider,
native session, active channel mapping, and local node. Agent-visible peers and
tasks contain aliases and authorized envelopes rather than raw destination
IDs. A short-lived bounded `session.teamTurn` gives only a current
owner-initiated coordinator turn dispatch and task-control authority;
collaborator and local terminal turns clear it. A delegated worker task is
narrower still: only its exact assigned live session may reply. The coordinator
may cancel/replace its exact queued tasks and send an audited message to the
exact authoritative session owning an active task; every operation is bounded,
idempotent, and journaled before Slack or provider effects.

Tasks created by the current bridge use a two-phase completion protocol. The
end of one provider turn is only a durable report and moves the task to
`awaiting_release`; it does not clear the worker reservation. The worker
maintains an explicit bounded pending-gate set, must clear it, and must declare
completion before the coordinator can release the task. Coordinator follow-up
invalidates the old declaration. Accepted follow-ups fence completion and
release until exact provider delivery. Before provider input, SAB journals the
intended generation; accepted input promotes it to a bounded durable native-turn
fingerprint. Provider finals resolve that fingerprint by native turn identity or
event observation time rather than sampling mutable task state, so a delayed
earlier final cannot be mistaken for the follow-up result. An active provider
poller's fallback fingerprint advances at the same acceptance boundary, and a
delayed prompt acknowledgement may enter bounded history but cannot replace a
newer generation. Each asynchronous poller observation retains the immutable
generation with which it began and is invalidated when accepted follow-up input
advances that generation. Initial and follow-up envelopes both bind their exact
generation; an inherited native turn identity remains provisional until a hook
confirms it, and a recovered prompt acknowledgement is persisted before any
Slack audit await. Codex checks generation ownership before stopping a poller or
clearing live turn state. A discarded stale Claude final advances its transcript
offset only to the next generation marker whether it became stale before or
during finalization, while an authenticated completion declaration supplies the
same live worker proof as a reply. Once provider input succeeds, failure to persist that
activation is an uncertain delivery: SAB retains the task reservation and
never attempts a second transport. Pre-upgrade tasks without an explicit
completion policy retain provider-final semantics so an upgrade cannot
reinterpret an already-running turn.

Teams may opt into `auto-until-blocked` continuation. Every authenticated
worker reply—including ordinary progress and idempotent retries that heal a
dispatch—or task result is persisted and delivered before creating one deduplicated
continuation event. An idle authoritative coordinator receives a bounded,
bridge-marked owner continuation and rereads the authoritative inbox and team
context before dispatching. Existing teams remain `manual` by default;
automatic continuation is serialized per team, survives daemon restart through
the state journal, and pauses with an actionable owner notification when the
coordinator is missing, busy, or a safety/product decision is required.
On restart, a journaled active wake is accepted as delivered only when the exact
coordinator PID/tmux and provider turn are re-adopted. Otherwise it is settled
as interrupted, its matching bridge-owned authority is released, and the
uncertain prompt is never replayed. A persisted provider start timestamp is
historical context, not live-turn proof; recovery requires the provider poller
to have been restored from provider-specific post-restart evidence.
An independent durable `draining` mode lets active workers finish while blocking
queued claims and continuation wakes until dispatch is explicitly resumed.

The same coordinator provider turn may remain active across many worker refill
cycles. Its dispatch budget is never made unlimited: after the current budget is
exhausted, SAB can renew exactly one bounded budget only by atomically claiming
pending authenticated worker events for that exact automatic team. The claimed
event and replacement continuation authority are persisted together before a
new task, file staging, Slack audit, or provider injection. Manual teams,
collaborator turns, unrelated-team events, and an exhausted turn with no new
worker event remain denied.

Because the inbox is authoritative, all events pending when a continuation is
claimed are durably coalesced into one wake rather than replayed as separate
model turns. A task/reply lifecycle transition and its continuation event enter
the same atomic state write before any Slack delivery or provider wake. Covered
event keys bind task, reply, and task-lifecycle version and remain in the bounded
record after settlement for retry idempotency. A resumed Codex coordinator may exceptionally omit both prompt and
completion hooks. SAB may release only its bridge-owned turn/input fences after
the exact authoritative PID/tmux has shown the native idle input surface twice,
unchanged, after a grace period. This path never parses a transcript or terminal
answer and never completes a delegated worker task. A changed session, process,
turn fingerprint, queued input, permission, transition, or task resets the proof.
Ordinary busy waits receive one delayed visible notice instead of remaining
silent indefinitely.

The same hookless-resume fence applies to an ordinary owner turn in a worker
channel. Its Codex poller records the immutable session/PID/tmux/turn
fingerprint, requires the exact authoritative root process, and releases the
bridge-owned input and turn markers only after the repeated idle proof. It then
persists the cleanup before waking team reconciliation. Because the guard
requires no delegated task and the exact channel/session mapping, a fresh
queued task can claim that worker once without replaying a failed pre-reboot
task or mutating a replacement session.

A delegated Codex task uses a stricter variant of the same live proof. If the
exact continuously observed process returns to idle twice after the grace
period, the injected turn is over even when acknowledgement and completion
hooks are absent. SAB records a warning-bearing report, never fabricates a
stable final, and keeps the task and worker reserved for coordinator follow-up
or explicit release. An idle legacy task discovered during boot has no
continuous delivery proof and therefore fails closed instead. A persisted
`awaiting_release` report is already durable proof and is re-adopted without
replaying provider input, even while its provider is dormant. An owner may wake
that exact reserved session without submitting the wake message as task input.
Coordinator follow-ups are journaled and mirrored to both channels before a
dormant provider defers their exact-once injection; successful injection creates
fresh in-memory turn proof for restart reconciliation.

The process claim also requires the provider to be the root provider process
under the SAB tmux pane. Nested utilities such as `codex review` inherit the
parent environment but are rejected before SessionStart registration and before
any team or artifact authority check, so one-off child work cannot create ghost
channels or masquerade as the interactive session.

Task delivery is journal-first:

1. Revalidate source authority, owner turn, team edge, target mapping, and
   request identity; stage any approved files from the source workspace.
2. Atomically persist a unique queued task, then publish its complete bounded
   payload and idempotent status cards in both Slack channels.
3. Wait while the target is dormant, busy, switching, asking a question,
   awaiting permission, under maintenance.
4. Serialize both visible instruction-card updates for each replacement and
   bind the final claim to that exact fully audited instruction revision. Then
   reserve the worker input surface, atomically change `queued → dispatching`,
   populate `startedAt`, and bind `session.teamActiveTaskId` plus the exact target
   native session before provider injection. Availability derives from the same
   durable record, so no dispatching worker can be reported ready. A restart
   never retries an uncertain dispatch claim.
5. Accept `running` when the provider acknowledges the injected immutable task
   marker, or when the exact process-bound worker successfully journals a reply
   for that task. The latter is durable acceptance proof when a provider omits
   its prompt hook; it is not final-result proof. Claude's completed transcript
   path or Codex's Stop hook or matching successful App Server turn supplies a
   provider final. That final changes a new task to `awaiting_release`, posts its report,
   and leaves `session.teamActiveTaskId` intact. Coordinator follow-ups are
   serialized in durable acceptance order; a coordinator release is persisted
   without being reclassified as an authenticated worker continuation event.
6. A worker checkpoint atomically replaces the complete bounded pending-gate
   set. A completion declaration is rejected while any gate remains. Once the
   worker declares readiness with the work generation from its current
   authenticated prompt and a later exact provider-turn report exists, an
   authorized coordinator may release the task. A coordinator message invalidates stale
   readiness and fences release from journal acceptance through exact provider
   delivery. Release requires a readiness declaration and a subsequent report
   from the latest delivered work generation. "Subsequent" is proved by the
   provider-boundary observation timestamp, not by when delayed hook or Slack
   processing happened to append the report journal. Exact provider-turn keys coalesce
   duplicate lifecycle delivery without discarding later turns in that same
   generation; a terminal task can receive work only as a new
   linked task.
7. Persist `completed`, `completed_with_warning`, failure, or cancellation and a
   delivery claim before updating both audit cards and
   idempotently posting the stable result in the coordinator channel. A missing
   or uneditable audit card is reported with the result but cannot suppress it;
   reconciliation retries incomplete result delivery before releasing bounded
   state. Only fully delivered terminal records are eligible for TTL or journal
   pressure pruning, and the pruned journal is persisted before file cleanup.

Interim provider commentary remains in the worker channel; a worker explicitly
uses `sab team reply` to put selected progress in the source mailbox. Questions
and permissions stay on the worker's normal Slack surface. A coordinator uses
`sab team message` to answer or amend an exact active task, with a visible copy
in both channels; SAB refuses delivery while a question or permission surface
is open, and an uncertain provider attempt is never replayed. Team file relay is separate from artifact grants. It applies the artifact
realpath/regular-file/count/aggregate-size validator to the exact source
workspace, hashes content for retry conflict detection, writes mode-0600 copies
under `~/.config/ccs/team-files`, uploads the copies to the linked Slack channel,
and injects only destination-private paths. Staged content and terminal task
metadata expire under the bounded journal.

Remote-node dispatch is deliberately not enabled. Task records already carry
node identities so the accepted authenticated command/event/file transport can
replace the local delivery adapter later without changing `/sab-team` or `sab
team`. See [Session teams](docs/session-teams.md).

## Provider adapters

### Claude Code

Claude inbound messages use the explicitly configured MCP Channel server,
selected through Claude's approved `--channels` path. Headless launches never
depend on the interactive development-channel confirmation. Hooks mirror
lifecycle and outbound final content; its transcript and statusline support live
progress, account usage, and topic metadata. `AskUserQuestion` uses the bounded
structured `PreToolUse.tool_input.questions` payload for Slack text,
descriptions, previews, and concise buttons, while tmux key input remains the
answer transport.
A pane parser handles only restart recovery, legacy Claude versions, and
post-Stop approval screens; a live structured form cannot be overwritten by its
width-dependent terminal rendering. For an owner-selected workspace, the
bounded startup helper confirms trust only after the affirmative trust row is
visibly selected; it fails closed on unknown prompt rendering. Claude keeps
consent and account-switching paths. Remote flagless sessions default to
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`; `--dsp` normalizes to that flag. `--chrome`
is Claude-specific.

### Codex

Codex inbound text and interrupts use tmux. Hooks provide native IDs, turn
boundaries, permission decisions, and normally the stable final assistant text.
The App Server proxy is a bounded supplementary egress path: it forwards every
protocol frame unchanged, submits completed `agentMessage` values explicitly
marked `commentary`, and holds one `final_answer` until its matching successful
`turn/completed`. That final uses the same durable turn claim as a late Stop
hook, addressing Codex App Server releases that omit Stop without parsing the
transcript or terminal. It never emits commands, command output, diffs, plans,
reasoning, or deltas. Stable commentary/final deliveries retain their App
Server source order across loopback retries, so a later final cannot overtake
an earlier response. The proxy stamps a final at the App Server completion
boundary; if loopback or Slack backoff delays delivery beyond the start of a
newer turn, that older final cannot clear the newer poller, status, reservation,
or delegated-task lifecycle. On proxy shutdown, commentary backoff is curtailed, both
WebSocket ingress surfaces close to establish a final frame boundary, and the
latest accepted delivery tail is followed until it is stable for one event-loop
turn, for up to 30 seconds. Stable finals keep
their real retry spacing during that drain, so transient pressure is not turned
into an immediate exhausted burst. The runner keeps the correlated App Server
alive until that drain finishes so the daemon can still prove the delivery's
process ancestry. Drain
exhaustion is printed with the proxy diagnostic and makes the runner fail
rather than silently treating a possibly missing final as success. Before
applying the exact-process fence, the daemon
canonicalizes npm's persistent App Server launcher to its direct matching
native child—the identity emitted by lifecycle hooks—and then revalidates that
child against the exact tmux. If either sidecar cannot start, the runner falls
back to the direct TUI. Transcript JSONL is never parsed; `ccusage` is the
public usage adapter. One bounded TUI exception handles Codex's fixed model
capacity rejection, which can return to idle without emitting `Stop`: only the
exact warning in the visible terminal tail, on a proven idle input surface and
across two consecutive live observations, may replace the working timer with a
failure. Startup recovery applies the same exact current-tail check to a
persisted orphan turn. Stale scrollback and conversational mentions never
qualify. Every SAB-managed Codex TUI receives the fixed internal
`check_for_update_on_startup=false` override so its detached startup cannot be
captured by the native update chooser; provider binaries are updated only by
the explicit SAB maintenance path. The override is not persisted as a user
launch flag. A legacy chooser that still appears during provider switching is
recognized as an immediate actionable startup failure. Remote flagless
sessions default to Codex's canonical dangerous flag (`--yolo`). Requested
model/effort are durable launch intent, distinct from the actual model reported
by Codex. A capacity fallback may update the actual model shown in the topic,
but it cannot overwrite the requested model used on the next resume; a mismatch
is reported visibly in the session channel. A footer becomes the new durable
resume intent only when the idle, authoritative TUI also renders Codex's
explicit `Model changed to …` confirmation; a plain footer mismatch is never
treated as operator intent because it may be a capacity fallback. Claude similarly rebuild resume arguments
from their latest known native model and effort, stripping stale original
model/effort flags first.

## Working status and output

Hooks start provider-specific live pollers. The daemon stores restart metadata
needed to recover an in-progress turn, finds the frozen Slack status message on
boot, re-adopts it, and continues the original elapsed duration. New channel
content re-anchors the status as the latest item without resetting it. All
status mutations pass through one workspace-wide, rate-safe queue. Superseded
timer edits are cancelled before Slack I/O, and end-of-turn cleanup has priority
over cosmetic updates from other sessions; a clear with no posted status never
consumes an API slot. Provider commentary and finals use the ordinary
per-channel output path without waiting for status mutation, so a Slack
`chat.update` backoff cannot hold the stable response behind its timer. Queue
pressure is visible through `/sab-health`.

Final text comes only from provider-stable sources. Claude reads completed
transcript records, Codex uses either the Stop hook's final field or the exact
App Server `final_answer` after a successful matching `turn/completed`. The two Codex sources atomically claim the same native
turn before Slack delivery. Codex turns that omit `UserPromptSubmit` are tracked from the
successful bridge injection, and a rendered `Working (...)` footer allows
restart re-adoption when the timestamp was lost. Two unchanged idle-surface
observations can release an owner turn. For an exact delegated turn observed
continuously by the live poller, they complete that task with an explicit
warning and never fabricate or replay a final. An already-idle delegated task
discovered only during boot still fails closed. Deduplication fences hook
retries and restart races.

## Provider switching

Switching is a journaled transaction:

1. Validate the source mapping, idle state, target choice, and target flags.
2. Optionally inspect root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` and produce a bounded,
   hash-protected instruction proposal for owner review.
3. Capture a private source-native handoff. It is not mirrored into Slack.
4. Stop the source process and launch/resume the target in detached tmux.
5. Wait for the target's native input surface and run a private read-only
   validation turn.
6. Atomically commit the target mapping, update the topic, and release queued
   owner messages.

The source remains authoritative until commit. Any failure rolls back, reaps
the provisional target, and restores/resumes the source. A daemon restart uses
the same journal to make the rollback deterministic. Collaborators are rejected
during a switch; owner messages are bounded and queued. Artifact grants for the
source are revoked at commit and grants for queued messages are minted only for
the committed target.

## Collaborators and artifacts

The session status picker calls `conversations.invite` before modifying the
per-channel prompt allowlist. Invitation failure is shown to the owner and
leaves the user untrusted. Collaborators may prompt only a live explicitly
allowed session; they cannot run slash commands, resurrect, or answer
permissions.

Accepted owner/collaborator prompts may receive an opaque one-use artifact
grant. It binds sender, message/thread, provider, native session, pid/tmux,
channel, and canonical workspace. The agent supplies only file paths. The
daemon fixes the Slack destination and validates realpath containment, regular
file type, count, aggregate size, expiry, and replay state.

## Loopback APIs

Port `8877` binds only to loopback and carries hooks, status, provider streams,
permission decisions, artifacts, terminal control, session-team mailboxes,
legacy `/spawn`, and the automation lifecycle API. It must never be proxied or forwarded. Script-facing
mutations require JSON and reject browser Origin/fetch metadata and non-loopback
Host headers.

Terminal endpoints are:

- `GET /terminals`
- `POST /terminals/open` with `{ "selector": "…" }` or `{ "all": true }`
- `POST /terminals/close` with the same shape

Automation endpoints are:

- `POST /automation/sessions`
- `GET /automation/sessions/:externalKey`
- `POST /automation/sessions/:externalKey/stop`

The local CLI also exposes side-effect-free `sab automation validate-flags`.
It invokes the canonical provider adapter directly, allowing a project
orchestrator to reject invalid argv before allocating project resources.

Team endpoints are:

- `GET /team/context`, `/team/peers`, and `/team/inbox`
- `GET /team/tasks/:taskId` and `/team/mutations/:requestId`
- `POST /team/send`, `/team/reply`, `/team/checkpoint`, `/team/complete`,
  `/team/release`, `/team/continue`, `/team/message`, `/team/replace`,
  `/team/cancel`, and `/team/mode`

Every endpoint rejects browser origins and non-loopback Host values. Team
mutations additionally require exact provider-process/tmux ancestry; no bearer
capability or Slack destination is accepted from the caller.

Automation creation atomically records its external key and deterministic tmux
identity before launch. Duplicate keys return the existing record. Native
session/channel correlation precedes collaborator invitation; all invitations
and name resolution precede whitelisting and initial-prompt injection. The
prompt is claimed at most once and receives no artifact grant. Exact stop
revalidates every binding, revokes grants and handoff state, stops only the
correlated process/tmux, and optionally archives only that immutable channel.
Codex automation startup does not depend solely on a release-specific hook:
the transparent proxy forwards a validated root App Server `thread/started`
identity to `/codex/bootstrap`. The daemon accepts it only while the exact
automation is `launching` or `awaiting_session`, with matching canonical cwd,
tmux, and provider-root ancestry, then feeds it through the ordinary
SessionStart/channel/invitation/prompt correlation path. Concurrent native-hook
and App Server events deduplicate there. Unrelated sessions, stopped records,
cwd mismatches, replacement identities, and child threads cannot adopt it.

## Installation and updates

`install.sh` maintains one checkout and the historical
`si.sergej.claudeslackproxy` LaunchAgent label. It installs only the `sab`
symlink and removes old launcher symlinks. Existing `CCS_*`,
`~/.config/ccs`, old checkout paths, control channels, state records, and local
port remain compatible. A no-reload staged activation checks both the loaded
LaunchAgent job and its installed plist working directory, then refuses a
different or unverifiable checkout before any mutation. For a piped installer,
that check precedes even clone or pull. This remains effective when the plist
was moved or deleted while launchd retained the job, so development worktrees
cannot replace live Git state, hooks, or the public executable.

Self-update and release rollout must occur from a clean release commit during a
maintenance window. The prior tag and config backup remain available until
existing and new sessions for every installed provider pass the release
canary.

The multi-node foundation adds no listener by default, Slack scope, manifest
command, or second Slack daemon. Explicit listener configuration enables only
one-use enrollment and authenticated heartbeat transport. Remote provider work
remains unavailable until durable replay, node-local lifecycle, coordinator
projection, and node-scoped Slack authorization pass the remaining delivery
gates in the accepted architecture document.
