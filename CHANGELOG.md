# Changelog

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-15

### Changed
- Native Codex-only TypeScript gateway and independent per-computer connectors.
- Private single-use Slack pairing, explicit task registration, owner-controlled sharing and revocation.
- Background start/stop commands with private loopback shutdown controls.
- Vitest tests exclusively in tests/. Removed the obsolete terminal daemon, Pi/Claude adapters, hooks and installers; no .mjs source remains.

### Fixed
- Initialize fresh native tasks before closing setup so their first resume succeeds.
- Preserve exact reply roots and reject offline routing without local fallback or uncertain replay.

### Verification
- Windows and macOS build, strict typechecking, 24 Vitest tests and dependency audit.
- Live tests in a dedicated private channel: two devices, independent context, offline rejection and restart/resume.


## 2.1 development snapshot (d30e521, superseded by 3.0.0)

### Added

- Named agent creation through Slack mentions, durable thread-reply routing,
  per-owner agents and explicit collaborator sharing using native Codex App
  Server. New TypeScript tests are centralized under `tests/direct/` with Vitest.

- TypeScript direct Codex mode for one explicit Slack owner/channel and native
  task, using the existing Codex App Server and login without tmux or a terminal
  UI. Includes native message/approval/stop handling, metadata/attachment probes,
  and durable duplicate suppression. Legacy team and file features remain in
  the terminal daemon.

### Removed

- Pi provider, native extension, managed runs, installer, and Slack controls.
  This fork supports Claude Code and Codex using existing local CLIs.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `sab automation validate-flags` provides project orchestrators with a
  side-effect-free JSON-safe preflight using the canonical provider allowlist.
- New session-team tasks now use explicit two-phase completion: bounded worker
  checkpoints declare pending gates, worker completion declares readiness, and
  an exact coordinator release is required before worker availability clears.
- `sab team checkpoint`, `complete`, `release`, `continue`, and `mutation` add
  gate tracking, linked post-completion follow-up, and queryable request-ID
  receipts for ambiguous client outcomes.
- Team context and task envelopes expose observation timestamps, current
  availability reasons, and last durable transition reasons.

### Changed

- Codex automation flags accept strictly validated split or inline model and
  effort syntax; effort is translated to the narrow native configuration argv
  without permitting arbitrary `--config` input.
- A provider final or continuously observed hookless Codex idle surface is now
  a durable worker turn report, not implicit task completion. Coordinator
  follow-up invalidates an earlier readiness declaration, while pre-upgrade
  tasks retain their historical provider-final behavior.

### Fixed

- Codex sessions resume again under Codex >= 0.154, which refuses a permission
  override when resuming a remote (app-server) task ("Permission overrides are
  not supported when resuming a remote task") and so crashed every bridge Codex
  resume at startup. On a remote resume the launcher now applies the permission
  posture to the app-server and strips the override from the resume client,
  preserving Full Access while the resume proceeds; the direct fallback still
  carries the override.
- Fresh Codex automations no longer deadlock while waiting for a deferred
  `SessionStart`. The typed root App Server `thread/started` event can bootstrap
  only the exact pending automation through the existing fenced SessionStart
  path; native-hook races deduplicate and child/unrelated threads stay excluded.
- Coordinator waits now return the actionable `awaiting_release` state instead
  of deadlocking the only turn authorized to release the worker.
- Exact-generation Claude finalization is claimed before transcript settling,
  stale Pi finals are fenced before and after Slack delivery, and dormant
  coordinator messages no longer create three-second reconciliation log storms.
- Initial delegated prompts now carry their immutable work generation;
  sequential coordinator messages recompute resume semantics at delivery, and
  inherited Codex native-turn identities remain replaceable by exact later
  lifecycle events.
- Discarded stale Claude finals preserve the next generation's transcript
  boundary, while authenticated completion declarations establish live worker
  proof and heal a missed initial provider acknowledgement.
- In-flight Claude and Codex poller observations retain their starting work
  generation, recovered prompt identities become durable before audit I/O, and
  stale provider finals cannot stop or consume state belonging to a follow-up.
- Bound provider prompt acknowledgements and finals to immutable task
  generations across audit waits, serialized coordinator follow-ups, preserved
  reported workers that become dormant during Slack audit delivery, and kept
  coordinator release from generating spurious worker continuation authority.
- Restart reconciliation repairs only exact redundant session/task bindings,
  preserves reported tasks and their worker reservations across daemon or
  provider downtime, refuses conflicting bindings instead of guessing, and
  restores those bindings before Slack ingress can accept owner input.
- Every team mutation returns its journaled request receipt; generated CLI
  request IDs and safe retry/status guidance are retained across timeouts.
- Reported workers can be resumed by an owner without injecting unrelated task
  input. Deferred coordinator follow-ups are mirrored before provider delivery,
  establish fresh post-restart turn proof, and no longer fail valid re-adopted
  work as stale.
- Per-task request-ID collisions now fail before mutation, and delayed worker
  reports describe the current lifecycle instead of offering stale release
  guidance after a task has already moved on.
- Legacy queued work retains provider-final instructions, while delivery-time
  follow-up races, post-release completion retries, and renamed-worker
  continuations preserve their exact durable task identity.
- Completion declarations are fenced while coordinator follow-up is entering
  the provider, dormant wakeups preserve only durably reported work, and the
  bounded reply journal reserves capacity to clear the final task gate.
- Accepted coordinator messages now fence completion and release before Slack
  mirroring begins, and provider reports bind to a monotonic task-local work
  generation so a delayed earlier final cannot satisfy a delivered follow-up.
- Codex acknowledgement hooks now persist lifecycle tracking before audit I/O,
  only durably written hook acknowledgements may override a racing transport
  error, and idempotent release retries re-persist accepted terminal state.
- Delegated and coordinator-follow-up turns retain their pre-submit event
  boundary, and delayed Codex prompt hooks cannot restart a completed turn or
  retag lifecycle tracking after a newer work generation begins.
- Coordinator follow-up generations reset Claude spinner and Codex terminal
  failure/idle evidence, while successful `sab team` mutations retain their
  durable request receipts in CLI output.
- Native Codex prompt identities now give each newer turn its own lifecycle
  timestamp without losing the same turn's earlier transport boundary, and an
  accepted team-task retry remains queryable after its worker is removed.
- Completion declarations now carry the generation observed in the worker's
  current task prompt; release requires a subsequent exact-turn report, while
  later provider turns in the same work generation supersede earlier progress.
- Default cancellation receipts use their effective request identity, and
  idempotent mutation retries re-persist accepted in-memory state before
  reporting success.
- Staging a coordinator follow-up no longer captures the preceding turn's final,
  exact pending-generation prompt hooks can heal a transport race, and malformed
  empty checkpoint gate lists cannot impersonate the explicit `none` sentinel.
- Exact provider acknowledgements now require the current work generation,
  overtaking finals remain durably deferred until their staged input settles,
  and late Codex prompt hooks cannot recreate a released input reservation.
- Follow-up generations sharing one native provider turn retain distinct
  history entries, while coalesced undelivered reports receive fresh Slack
  idempotency identities instead of reusing an earlier accepted request.
- Deferred provider finals now journal an in-flight settlement claim and clear
  it atomically with the recovered task lifecycle, so a daemon crash cannot
  leave a claimed Codex or Pi final permanently fencing its worker task.
- Provider generations now retain a distinct acceptance boundary, preventing a
  pre-submit Claude final from being attributed to a follow-up whose transport
  promoted later; recovered checkpoint retries are re-journaled before Slack
  audit or reply delivery.
- Team prompt acknowledgements now require the durable digest of the exact
  bridge-delivered instruction, preventing pasted marker text from claiming a
  task generation; timestamp-less finals fail closed when multiple retained
  provider generations make attribution ambiguous.
- Completion declarations retain the provider generation observed before
  caller authentication, deferred finals cannot cross task identities, and
  malformed checkpoints without an explicit gate array now fail closed.
- Legacy tasks retain their historical 32-reply capacity, while a saturated
  cancellation journal rejects reuse of its terminal request ID with a changed
  payload.
- Provider turns now retain a bounded, durable task-generation fingerprint;
  delayed native finals resolve by turn identity or observation time instead of
  sampling mutable task state. Continuation timeout guidance no longer filters
  mutation lookup by the unknowable child task, and saturated cancelled-task
  retries fail explicitly instead of acknowledging an unqueryable receipt.
- Untracked post-upgrade follow-ups now require positive prompt evidence before
  accepting an overtaking final; Claude failure peeks are generation-scoped,
  revoked-task fallback pollers cannot wedge later turns, and mutation recovery
  re-persists the journal before confirming acceptance.
- Delegated input no longer falls through to a second transport after the
  provider accepted it but lifecycle persistence failed. Active fallback
  pollers advance with coordinator follow-ups, shared native turn IDs resolve
  to the generation current at hook observation time, and delayed prompt hooks
  cannot roll a task back to older work.
- Provider prompt acknowledgements now promote an exact pending generation
  after an uncertain tmux result. Delayed Claude finals are rejected before
  stopping a newer poller or consuming newer transcript output, and legacy
  empty finals retain their historical failure semantics.
- Historical Claude turn identities now survive task replacement long enough
  to discard only their stale transcript bytes. Authenticated worker proof and
  durable post-restart coordinator-message markers promote the exact pending
  generation instead of leaving work reserved or misclassifying it as local
  terminal input.
- An exact native prompt acknowledgement now settles a coordinator follow-up
  whose tmux delivery was uncertain or interrupted by restart. The authenticated
  acknowledgement wins a racing late transport error, advances the durable work
  generation once, and removes the stale completion/release fence.
- App Server finals now defer behind unresolved Codex team input just like Stop
  hooks, delayed older-generation prompt hooks cannot fail newer same-task work,
  and accepted continuation retries re-persist recovered state before success.
- Restart recovery now flushes settled durable provider finals before idle
  re-adoption, preserves any final whose side effects still need retrying, and
  refreshes pre-existing Claude/Codex pollers after repairing task bindings.
- Stale Claude Stop events now wait for transcript settlement before advancing
  past their generation, and reconciliation fences a task while a durably
  captured provider final remains pending after a transient flush failure.
- Claude task reports now select assistant output from the exact embedded work
  generation, and delayed team prompt hooks can no longer create a stale owner
  input reservation after newer work or coordinator release.
- Hookless Claude finals now follow their immutable pre-submit timestamp into a
  staged generation, streamed tool output persists its transcript-generation
  boundary, and boot repairs exact task bindings before recovering deferred
  finals or provider turns.
- Release readiness now uses provider-event observation order rather than
  journal insertion order, so a delayed older final cannot certify a later
  completion declaration.
- The production lockfile now resolves Hono 4.13.7, clearing the path-traversal,
  form-nesting denial-of-service, and query-fragment advisories reported against
  the earlier transitive release.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-09-08

### Added

- Owner-only interactive Slack management and App Home controls now sit over
  the existing `/sab-*` dispatcher. Parameterized commands remain compatible,
  while stale panels and provider/session mismatches fail closed.
- Session teams now support bounded automatic coordinator continuation,
  atomic worker dispatch, durable drain mode, exact queued-task cancellation
  and replacement, coordinator messages to active tasks, filtered cursor-based
  inboxes, and task-bound file delivery.
- The compatibility-preserving multi-node foundation adds authenticated node
  enrollment, pinned Ed25519 identities, connection epochs, scoped operators,
  and strict protocol validation. Remote provider routing remains deliberately
  disabled until its authenticated delivery path is complete.

### Changed

- Provider sessions remain tmux-owned and headless across daemon restarts,
  preserving the latest confirmed model and effort. Terminal windows remain
  optional viewports and do not control provider lifetime.
- Codex semantic commentary, completed finals, working status, and lifecycle
  recovery now use separate ordered, rate-safe paths so cosmetic status traffic
  cannot starve actual responses.

### Fixed

- Missing provider completion hooks, host restarts, replacement native session
  IDs, queued maintenance input, Slack rate limits, and delayed Codex finals now
  reconcile without replaying uncertain work, duplicating prompts, dropping
  accepted finals, or leaving workers permanently busy.
- Team lifecycle transitions atomically bind task, worker, channel, native
  session, PID/tmux authority, and lifecycle version. Successful hookless
  Codex workers become `completed_with_warning`; historical unproved work still
  fails closed and fresh queued work starts exactly once.
- Claude structured questions retain their prompt, recommendation,
  descriptions, and previews in Slack, and detached starts use the explicitly
  approved channel and workspace-trust paths.

### Security

- Artifact grants and team operations remain exact-session capabilities.
  Concurrent native replacement hooks now retain separate prompt-scoped grant
  authority, coordinator task messages journal before delivery, and stale,
  rebound, cross-node, cross-provider, or collaborator claims are rejected
  before mutation.

## [2.1.0-rc.17] — 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Concurrent native replacement hooks now retain separate, invocation-scoped
  snapshots of only the prompts that overlapped each hook. A later replacement
  can no longer inherit an earlier hook's accepted artifact-grant authority.

## [2.1.0-rc.16] — 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- A native replacement hook now snapshots the exact input-drain prompts that
  overlap its asynchronous PID/tmux authentication. Even if the drain finishes
  before the hook mutates the native session identity, their accepted upload
  grants remain available to the replacement; invalid hooks discard the
  snapshot without rebinding anything.

## [2.1.0-rc.15] — 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Native in-place session replacement now includes the exact prompt remainder
  temporarily owned by an active input drain when selecting artifact grants to
  rebind. A delivery failure after replacement can therefore restore and retry
  that accepted prompt without losing its one-use upload capability, while
  unrelated grants remain bound to the superseded session.

## [2.1.0-rc.14] — 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Native in-place session replacement now rebinds only artifact grants whose
  exact upload commands remain in the migrated pending-prompt queue. Other
  unexpired grants retain the superseded session binding and cannot become
  usable by a replacement merely because its channel, provider, and tmux match.
- `sab team message` and queued-task replacement now retain their generated
  request identity and print an exact safe-retry command after an uncertain
  client outcome, preserving journal idempotency without requiring callers to
  pre-generate UUIDs.
- A coordinator message interrupted while its provider write was in flight is
  persisted as `uncertain` on the first post-restart reconciliation. Later
  passes fail closed without repeatedly rewriting state or replaying the text.

## [2.1.0-rc.13] — 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Coordinator messages to an active Pi task now distinguish a disconnected
  input stream, where no provider write occurred, from an uncertain write. A
  provably undelivered message stays pending for bounded reconciliation after
  reconnect; a possibly delivered message remains failed and is never replayed.
- A delayed Codex App Server final records its completion-observation time and
  cannot stop the poller, clear the working line, or complete lifecycle state
  belonging to a newer turn. The older final remains eligible for exact-once
  Slack delivery without disturbing that newer turn.
- A reconnected Pi extension reports the native input surface's idle state. SAB
  restores polling for live work, or fail-closed releases an already-idle stale
  re-adopted task so fresh queued work can dispatch without a manual prompt.
- Bulk terminal open/close operations now revalidate each exact session,
  channel, and tmux authority after asynchronous liveness checks, preventing a
  replacement session from inheriting an operation aimed at its predecessor.

## [2.1.0-rc.12] — 2026-09-08

### Added

- Session teams can now enter durable `draining` mode: active work may finish,
  but queued work cannot dispatch until the owner or coordinator resumes the
  team. Coordinators can idempotently cancel or replace an exact queued task and
  can send a journaled, visibly audited message to the exact live worker that
  owns an active task.
- `sab team inbox` now retains the original bounded task instruction and adds
  `--active`, `--target`, `--status`, `--since`, opaque cursor pagination, and a
  page-shaped JSON result. The legacy `--after` form remains compatible.

### Fixed

- A live Codex worker that demonstrably returns to the idle input surface after
  an injected task no longer records successful work as failed merely because
  the completion hook was omitted. SAB records `completed_with_warning`, never
  replays the turn, releases worker availability, and dispatches the next queued
  task once. Boot-time idle without continuous delivery proof still fails
  closed, preserving the no-replay boundary for historical pre-restart work.
- Worker availability and task lifecycle now move together in one persisted
  dispatch claim. A `dispatching` task has `startedAt` immediately, and durable
  active-task state prevents a transient ready report or duplicate claim even
  if session-local state is stale.
- Automatic coordinator notifications are durably deduplicated by task, reply,
  and lifecycle version, and pending events are coalesced before a continuation
  wake. Ordinary worker replies and idempotent dispatch-healing retries still
  enqueue exactly one wake.
- Restart adoption now distinguishes live provider-turn proof from an already
  idle historical task, preserves active tasks without manual session
  activation, and releases unprovable work without replay before fresh queued
  work can dispatch. A persisted Pi start timestamp is no longer treated as
  post-restart liveness: native Pi activity must return before SAB restores its
  poller or delegated-task authority, and an unproved turn releases all stale
  poller/input state when the recovery grace period expires.
- Coordinator task messages bind the exact task, channel, native session, PID,
  and input surface; the journal is persisted before Slack/provider effects and
  an uncertain provider attempt is never retried. The final provider attempt is
  single-transport and revalidates that immutable binding after submission.
  Delivery also refuses an input surface displaying a question or permission
  prompt, so coordinator text cannot be pasted into an operator-choice UI.
- Codex event-proxy shutdown now skips all queued commentary immediately rather
  than spending one request timeout per item ahead of an accepted stable final.
  It closes WebSocket ingress before following the current delivery tail to
  quiescence, so a completion frame already queued by the socket cannot be lost
  behind a stale shutdown snapshot. Stable finals retain their retry spacing
  during shutdown, and a rejected or exhausted final makes the proxy/runner fail
  instead of reporting a clean drain.
  A reconnected Pi stream resumes the sole ordered maintenance-input drain, so
  accepted prompts cannot remain fenced after extension reconnect; a superseded
  Pi stream cannot drain input reserved for its replacement, and no Pi stream
  can drain until the exact SessionStart metadata work has completed.
- Drain activation is rechecked at the continuation claim boundary, instruction
  card revisions remain retryable when either audit card is absent, and idle
  restart adoption revalidates the exact provider process after asynchronous
  Slack cleanup before releasing task or owner-turn fences.
- Session-start and maintenance-input fences now carry opaque runtime ownership
  generations across native identity replacement. A delayed metadata failure or
  cleanup timer can release only its own generation, never a newer restart's
  queued-input fence.
- Concurrent queued-task replacements serialize their paired Slack audit-card
  updates. The final dispatch claim is bound to that same fully audited
  instruction revision, preventing a replacement from racing into a worker
  under mixed or stale visible instructions.
- Claude model selections made through Slack are now persisted just like effort
  selections before the confirmation/topic update, so daemon restarts and
  later session updates cannot fall back to the session's original model.
- Replacement input-drain ownership now follows the stable session record
  across native identity changes, preventing racing lifecycle/Pi-stream
  callbacks from creating two queue consumers under the old and new ids.
- An automatic coordinator wake left `active` by a daemon crash no longer wedges
  later events forever. SAB adopts it only when the exact provider turn remains
  live; otherwise it records an actionable interrupted outcome and never
  replays the uncertain coordinator prompt. Persisted Codex/Pi start timestamps
  are not sufficient proof: restart adoption requires a provider poller restored
  from live post-restart evidence.

## [2.1.0-rc.11] — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Provider maintenance now has one ordered input consumer across launch,
  lifecycle adoption, and provider stream attachment. Codex no longer removes
  the first prompt into its resume command, and Claude/Pi reconnects cannot
  overtake an earlier queued prompt. Failed delivery restores the exact item
  and its deduplication claim for an explicit retry.
- A failed dormant wake or SessionStart metadata call no longer leaves queued
  owner input behind a permanent maintenance fence. The queue remains intact,
  a later owner message retries a genuinely dormant session, and Slack reports
  the exact-session `/sab-update` recovery path.
- Artifact grants carried by queued prompts now follow only a verified
  same-provider, same-channel native session replacement. Unrelated grants and
  provider handoffs remain isolated or revoked.
- Piped no-reload installation verifies the loaded LaunchAgent target before
  clone, pull, hook, configuration, or executable changes. A mismatched live
  checkout therefore fails without touching Git.
- Codex runner shutdown now propagates an exhausted commentary/final drain as
  a visible nonzero failure and includes the bounded proxy diagnostic instead
  of silently presenting the TUI exit as successful.

## [2.1.0-rc.10] — 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Provider maintenance now carries its queued owner input and restart fences
  across a verified native session-ID replacement such as Claude `/clear`.
  Replacement startup keeps direct input closed until the entire live queue,
  including prompts arriving during the drain, reaches the provider in order.
- Codex runner shutdown now keeps the correlated App Server process alive until
  the event proxy finishes its bounded commentary/final drain. The daemon can
  therefore still prove the final response's exact process ancestry while it
  is being delivered.
- No-reload installation now verifies the currently loaded historical
  LaunchAgent as well as its on-disk plist. A deleted or moved plist can no
  longer let a disposable worktree redirect live hooks and the public `sab`
  executable.
- The event-proxy shutdown regression no longer misses an already-observed
  child exit on faster Node runtimes.

## [2.1.0-rc.9] — 2026-09-07

### Added

- Added owner-only interactive Slack management without introducing another
  command namespace. No-argument `/sab-model`, `/sab-effort`, `/sab-terminal`,
  `/sab-update`, `/sab-switch`, `/sab-new`, and `/sab-team` render provider-aware
  selectors or buttons, while `/sab-status` adds exact session/control
  dashboards. Parameterized commands remain available, and `/sab-update
  current` provides an explicit direct current-session update.
- Added an owner-only App Home dashboard over the same validated dispatcher. It
  lists authoritative session channels, provides exact provider/session
  controls, and opens an allowlisted new-session modal. Non-owners receive no
  session metadata or actions. The Home tab uses the existing Socket Mode
  connection and requires no additional OAuth scope.
- Added opt-in, durable `auto-until-blocked` team continuation. Completed or
  blocked executor replies enqueue deduplicated events; an idle authoritative
  coordinator receives a bounded continuation turn and resumes after daemon
  restart, while existing teams remain manual.
- Added bridge-owned session teams for secure coordinator/worker delegation
  across explicitly linked local SAB channels. Owner-only `/sab-team`
  administration, repeated provider-neutral role context, the JSON-safe `sab
  team` mailbox, durable idempotent task phases, safe busy-worker queueing,
  provider-final correlation, visible two-channel audit records, and opt-in
  workspace-contained file relay remove the human copy/paste proxy without
  exposing Slack credentials or arbitrary channel history.
- Began the compatibility-preserving multi-node foundation: legacy sessions
  implicitly remain on the local node, explicit channel/session/node routes fail
  closed on disagreement, and spawn plus terminal operations now cross an
  execution-node adapter boundary. Strict control-envelope validation and a
  registry for pinned Ed25519 node identities, scoped operators, defaults, and
  revocation establish the next transport boundary. Socket Mode acknowledgement
  and Slack client ownership now sit behind an explicit sole-coordinator
  boundary. Added opt-in TLS node enrollment with hashed one-use invitations,
  node-local Ed25519 keys, signed nonce authentication, durable connection
  epochs, stale-socket fencing, heartbeats, exact revocation, a loopback-only
  administrator API, and JSON-safe `sab node` commands. The listener stays off
  by default and enrolled nodes cannot receive provider sessions yet. The
  accepted coordinator protocol, roles, recovery, and security design is
  documented.

### Fixed

- Codex proxy shutdown now interrupts expendable commentary backoff and drains
  already accepted stable finals before exiting, with a bounded visible failure
  if local delivery cannot recover. A missing Codex `Stop` can therefore no
  longer lose its App Server fallback final merely because the TUI closes.
- Staged provider activation now refuses to run from a checkout different from
  the LaunchAgent's live working directory. It fails before touching Git,
  provider hooks, configuration, or the public `sab` link, preventing an
  isolated release worktree from becoming a disposable runtime dependency.
- Interactive team Refresh and auto/manual actions now render a fresh team
  status and control panel after they run, so state-dependent buttons cannot
  remain stale and strand the owner on the previous continuation mode.
- Codex semantic commentary and completed finals now cross the loopback event
  proxy in their exact App Server source order. A delayed earlier Slack/daemon
  delivery can no longer be overtaken by a later final and then rejected as
  stale; per-event deduplication and bounded retries remain intact.
- Provider commentary and final responses no longer wait behind rate-limited
  working-status edits or deletes. Status cleanup invalidates queued stale
  timers and replacement bumps at the final Slack boundary, takes priority over
  other cosmetic updates, and exposes its current queue pressure through
  `/sab-health`.
- Re-running an installer now replaces stale SAB provider hooks left by deleted
  development worktrees or arbitrary custom checkout paths while preserving
  unrelated hooks and registering the live checkout exactly once. The provider
  staging helpers also make `--help` side-effect-free and reject unknown
  arguments.
- Interactive session controls carry their immutable rendered session identity
  through asynchronous provider-catalog, terminal, update, and switch checks,
  then revalidate it at every mutation boundary. Team controls additionally
  bind the exact rendered team generation, so neither `/clear` identity changes
  nor close-and-recreate races can redirect an old panel to replacement state.
- A completed turn now promotes every provisional status-reanchor cleanup ahead
  of unrelated cosmetic Slack traffic. A final that crosses the replacement
  post boundary invalidates both the old and provisional working lines instead
  of waiting behind the workspace timer queue.
- Provider updates reserve the exact native session before their first Slack
  notice, so delayed API calls cannot admit a second restart or lose a prompt.
  Status dashboards likewise bind the pre-await native identity, and empty
  status clears no longer consume workspace rate-limit slots.
- Pi model and effort controls now carry the expected native session into the
  extension and fail before mutation after a native conversation change.
  Provider maintenance rejects overlapping setting or lifecycle actions while
  retaining read-only management, and App Home no longer reports rejected
  switch requests as started.
- Deferred working-status cleanup retains the source channel captured when the
  turn finished, so a provider handoff cannot strand the old leg's timer. App
  Home stale-load recovery also renders a defined, internally consistent fresh
  overview.
- Status reanchor cleanup now retains that immutable source channel across the
  entire provisional bump, including a handoff that lands between replacement
  post and cleanup. Interactive option values preserve Slack's full
  150-character identity allowance and omit overlong values rather than
  truncating them into another project or model.
- Account, flag, and Codex model/effort restarts now reserve the exact native
  session before their first Slack wait. Overlapping controls are rejected and
  owner messages—including question-shaped replies—queue for the replacement
  process. A staged Pi extension fails closed with an actionable activation
  message when the older daemon cannot supply its native-session fence.
- A running Pi extension must now advertise exact-session setting support on
  its authenticated local stream before the daemon will send model or effort
  controls. Active Pi processes preserved across a daemon-only upgrade therefore
  fail closed with an actionable `/sab-update current` instruction instead of
  relying on an older extension to understand a new control field.
- Interactive Claude model choices now carry the exact provider model ID.
  Standard and 1M-context siblings remain distinct selections, while deliberate
  bare textual family aliases retain their documented long-context preference.
- Codex App Server turns no longer lose their final Slack response when Codex
  omits the configured Stop hook. The transparent proxy now releases only a
  completed `final_answer` after its exact successful `turn/completed`; the
  daemon revalidates PID/tmux/session/channel authority and atomically shares a
  bounded turn claim with late Stop hooks. Private handoff finals remain private,
  and tools, output, diffs, plans, reasoning, deltas, transcript JSONL, and
  failed/interrupted turns remain excluded.
- Codex turns that omit lifecycle hooks no longer lose their bridge status
  tracking when input was accepted through tmux or a daemon restart. SAB now
  re-adopts a verified rendered `Working (...)` turn, coalesces and rate-limits
  workspace-wide status edits, and releases an exact idle owner fence after
  two confirmations. A delegated task that returns idle without a stable Stop
  final is failed visibly and released without replay, preserving task and
  session authority boundaries.
- Slack responses are no longer starved behind unbounded per-session status
  updates. Status mutations share one global API queue and drop stale
  timer edits before Slack I/O, allowing commentary, final messages, and
  status cleanup to make progress under Slack's workspace-wide limits.

- Hookless Codex worker recovery no longer leaves resumed team workers
  permanently busy after a daemon restart. The exact authoritative worker
  process must show the same idle input surface twice after a grace period
  before SAB clears stale owner-turn fences, persists the cleanup, and wakes
  queued dispatch; delegated tasks and failed pre-reboot work remain protected.
- Long-running automatic team coordinators no longer stall after exactly 20
  delegations. Once the current bounded dispatch budget is exhausted, a pending
  authenticated worker event can atomically establish one new exact-team
  continuation budget; manual teams, collaborators, unrelated events, and
  eventless retries remain fail-closed.
- Provider update/restart now resumes Claude, Codex, and Pi with the latest
  known model and effort. Codex promotes only an explicit idle-TUI `Model
  changed to …` confirmation to durable intent, so an unexpected capacity
  fallback remains visible without replacing the requested settings.

- Automatic team continuation now wakes for every authenticated worker reply,
  including ordinary progress and dispatch-healing idempotent retries, instead
  of relying on blocker keywords. Events remain durable, coalesced, and
  opt-in, so this cannot create duplicate dispatches.

- Claude 2.1.258 can no longer strand headless starts and resumes at a detached
  development-channel confirmation. The runner now selects SAB's explicit local
  MCP server through the approved `--channels` path. Its changed workspace-trust
  screen now receives an explicit affirmative selection instead of confirming
  the default `No, exit`, while preserving the same provider lifecycle hooks.
- Claude resurrection no longer mistakes a briefly materialized tmux for an
  active session. SAB now waits for the exact `SessionStart` PID/tmux claim,
  retries a transient provider exit once, records only its bounded numeric exit
  status, and visibly reports final failure after clearing stale input and
  viewport claims while preserving the queued message.
- Delegated work no longer fails as an uncertain dispatch when the exact
  authenticated worker has already returned a task-bound update but Codex
  omitted `UserPromptSubmit`. The reply now atomically proves the `running`
  transition, restores live Codex status tracking, and heals the same persisted
  pre-upgrade state after restart without treating interim text as a final.
  Reconciliation also requires the session's exact active-task claim before it
  can mutate or release that worker.
- Automatic team continuation no longer remains silently blocked when a resumed
  Codex coordinator returns to its idle input surface without emitting prompt or
  completion hooks. Exact PID/tmux and unchanged-turn idle proof now releases
  only stale coordinator fences, concurrent executor events coalesce into one
  authoritative-inbox wake, and prolonged legitimate waits receive one visible
  coordinator-channel notice.
- Idle Codex resumes triggered by `/sab-model`, `/sab-effort`, `/sab-flags`, or
  an ordinary Slack wake now complete the same exact-tmux ancestry adoption as
  `/sab-update`. A visible TUI without `SessionStart` can no longer leave the
  session dormant, make `/sab-terminal open` fail, or permit competing resumes.
- Codex model capacity fallback no longer becomes the durable resume model.
  SAB now retains requested model/effort separately from the actual reported
  model, displays the actual runtime choice, and warns visibly on mismatch.
- SAB-managed Codex launches now disable the CLI's interactive startup update
  check, so an available Codex release cannot strand a new, resumed,
  automation-owned, or provisional provider-switch session before its hooks
  bind to Slack. Explicit `/sab-update` maintenance remains unchanged, and an
  unexpected legacy update chooser fails provider-switch validation with an
  actionable error instead of waiting for the full readiness timeout.
- Codex model-capacity rejections that return to the TUI without a `Stop` hook
  now clear the misleading working timer and post an actionable Slack failure.
  Detection is restricted to the exact current warning on a stable idle input
  surface, including daemon-restart recovery, so stale scrollback cannot end a
  later healthy turn.
- Nested Codex utilities such as `codex review` can no longer inherit a parent
  session's bridge identity and create a ghost Slack channel. Root-provider
  ancestry is now required for lifecycle, team, and artifact authority.
- Session-team review hardening now preserves exact native-session ownership,
  serializes input and file delivery, waits for provider task-marker
  acknowledgement, recovers or visibly releases interrupted work, enforces TTL
  for every active phase, reconciles idempotent completion delivery, cleans
  pruned file copies, preserves reply/file retry identities, removes failed
  queued prompts before provider reconnect, recognizes already-delivered legacy
  completions, clears rejected Pi inputs, and reports broken audit cards without
  withholding the stable result. Crash recovery clears abandoned input claims,
  running transitions update both audit cards, and pruning waits for complete
  delivery and persists before deleting staged bytes.
- Bulk session updates now skip workers with active delegated tasks, and dormant
  team channels are protected from cleanup until their membership is removed or
  the team is closed.
- Claude interactive questions now render from structured `AskUserQuestion`
  hook data, preserving the prompt, recommendation, descriptions, and previews
  while keeping Slack buttons concise. Wide terminal layouts can no longer fold
  their side-by-side preview panel into option labels or erase the question.

### Security

- Cross-channel calls now require exact provider-process ancestry, PID/tmux,
  native session, authoritative channel, local-node, owner-turn/task, and
  directed-edge agreement. Collaborator turns fail closed; uncertain restart
  dispatches are never replayed; team files use content-hashed private copies
  and a permission distinct from artifact grants.

[2.1.0]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v2.1.0
[2.1.0-rc.7]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v2.1.0-rc.7

## [2.0.1] — 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Codex interim commentary now correlates npm's persistent App Server launcher
  with its native child PID, so exact-process fencing no longer suppresses
  semantic progress after a native lifecycle hook or hookless resume adoption.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-08-26

### Added

- One `sab` CLI and one `/sab-*` Slack command namespace now control Claude
  Code, Codex, and Pi through their authoritative session provider.
- Detached-capable tmux owns provider lifetime while Ghostty windows are
  optional openable, focusable, and closable viewports.
- Provider switching preserves separate native Claude, Codex, and Pi legs in
  one Slack channel through private handoff, validation, rollback, and optional
  repository-instruction reconciliation.
- Provider-neutral artifact delivery, collaborator invitation/allowlisting,
  and an idempotent loopback automation lifecycle API support unattended work
  without allowing an agent to select a Slack destination.
- `/sab-update all` safely updates each represented provider CLI once and
  resumes every eligible idle authoritative session with its existing identity
  and settings.
- Pi includes native Slack transport, adaptive managed-run routing, persistent
  plans and goals, bounded subagents, independent review, safe-mode approval,
  images, settings, and usage reporting.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** provider-prefixed Slack command families and legacy launcher
  executables are replaced by `/sab-*` and `sab` subcommands. Existing state,
  channels, tmux names, `CCS_*` settings, port `8877`, checkout locations,
  control-channel identity, and historical LaunchAgent label remain compatible.
- Closing a terminal no longer terminates its provider. Sessions continue
  headlessly and can be reopened without resuming or duplicating them.

### Fixed

- Daemon restarts preserve working-status order, elapsed duration, and provider
  bindings without noisy unchanged-topic updates.
- Codex mirrors selected semantic interim commentary, reports live token usage,
  reconciles hookless interrupts, and recovers idle update resumes through an
  exact tmux-ancestry fallback when `SessionStart` is absent.
- Long Slack responses split at semantic or word boundaries, and provider
  startup/update failures produce actionable channel feedback.

### Security

- Terminal, update, switching, automation, collaborator, and artifact flows
  revalidate immutable channel/session authority and exact PID/tmux ancestry
  before mutation. Standby, provisional, stale, rebound, cross-channel, and
  unrelated processes fail closed.
- The daemon remains the sole Socket Mode and persisted-state owner; all local
  lifecycle APIs remain loopback-only and reject browser-originated mutation.

[2.0.1]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v2.0.1
[2.0.0]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v2.0.0

## [2.0.0-rc.2] — 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Idle Codex conversations resumed by `/sab-update` now become fully active
  even when Codex omits `SessionStart`. After a bounded native-hook grace period,
  the bridge adopts only the ancestry-validated Codex process inside the exact
  replacement tmux, atomically repairs its PID/channel transport mapping,
  flushes queued prompts once, and confirms `Resumed`. Daemon boot performs the
  same recovery for an update interrupted between process launch and lifecycle
  adoption, preventing duplicate Codex launches and false `/sab-terminal`
  failures.

[2.0.0-rc.2]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2

## [2.0.0-rc.1] — 2026-08-26

### Added

- One `sab` CLI now launches Claude, Codex, and Pi and exposes terminal,
  account, artifact, and automation subcommands.
- Headless tmux lifecycle decouples active providers from Ghostty. Local and
  Slack terminal controls list, open/focus, close, open all, or close all
  optional viewports without stopping sessions.
- Loopback terminal endpoints use the same authoritative-session resolver as
  Slack and reject browser-originated or non-JSON mutations.
- A 2.0 migration guide and release canary cover command replacement, manifest
  migration, headless adoption, and rollback.
- `/sab-update all` performs a guarded quiet-period sweep of every idle
  authoritative session, updates each represented provider CLI once, resumes
  native identities with their existing settings, queues messages during the
  relaunch, and reports every skip or failure.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Slack now exposes only the unified `/sab-*` namespace. Session
  channels infer their authoritative provider; `/sab-new` and `/sab-switch`
  require an explicit provider.
- Daemon-created, resumed, switched, and automated sessions start in detached
  tmux. Ghostty is opened only as an inspectable viewport or for an unavoidable
  provider-local trust gate.
- The canonical Slack manifest, installer, architecture, security contract,
  provider notes, contributor instructions, and README now describe the 2.0
  interface. Upgrading requires applying the manifest to the existing Slack app.
- New tmux names use `sab-*`; historical names already stored in state remain
  valid. Configuration, `CCS_*`, port `8877`, channels, checkout migration, and
  the historical LaunchAgent label remain compatible.

### Removed

- Removed every 1.x public launcher/helper executable: `ccs*`, `sab-cc`,
  `sab-codex`, `sab-pi`, `sab-upload`, and `sab-automation`. The installer
  removes only matching legacy symlinks and publishes `sab` alone.
- Removed the terminal-close watcher that previously killed a provider and
  converted its channel to dormant state.

### Security

- Terminal bulk actions derive targets only from exact active channel/session
  mappings and exclude standby, provisional, stale, and rebound records.
- Session update sweeps fail closed around active turns, questions,
  permissions, switches, managed Pi work, automation ownership, and concurrent
  wakes/restarts, with a second authority/PID/tmux check before each stop.
- Closing a terminal detaches only its tmux client and cannot send provider
  input or terminate the correlated process.

[2.0.0-rc.1]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1

## [1.5.0-rc.11] — 2026-08-26

### Added
- Bridged Codex sessions now mirror completed, user-facing interim commentary
  while a turn is active. A transparent loopback App Server proxy forwards the
  TUI protocol unchanged and excludes command lines/output, diffs, plans,
  reasoning, partial deltas, and final answers. Correlated PID/tmux/session/
  channel checks, bounded persisted item deduplication, status re-anchoring,
  retry across brief daemon outages, and direct-TUI fallback preserve existing
  lifecycle behavior. No Slack command or manifest update is required.

[1.5.0-rc.11]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.11

## [1.5.0-rc.10] — 2026-08-24

### Fixed
- Daemon restart now recognizes Codex's bridge-configured `f12 to interrupt`
  surface as active work, preserving the original long-running turn timer and
  restoring its Slack status instead of clearing both as apparently idle.
  Already-affected live turns safely reconstruct a missing start time from the
  frozen Slack timer or latest accepted prompt without parsing Codex JSONL.

[1.5.0-rc.10]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.10

## [1.5.0-rc.9] — 2026-08-24

### Added
- A loopback-only, persisted automation lifecycle API creates, queries, and
  exactly stops sessions by caller-supplied idempotency key. Native
  `SessionStart` correlation, per-collaborator invitation/name/allowlist state,
  at-most-once initial-prompt claims, exact channel archiving, grant revocation,
  and restart recovery are journaled atomically.
- `sab-automation` provides JSON-safe create/status/stop commands with prompt
  input from a file or stdin.

### Fixed
- The manual collaborator picker now invites the selected user to the private
  Slack channel before whitelisting them and reports actionable invitation
  failures without granting prompt access.
- Automation lifecycle races now preserve late `SessionStart` correlation,
  fence prompt injection after every stop request, verify provider input before
  claiming a prompt, and serialize exact stop against launch completion. Exact
  stop now fails visibly when cleanup is incomplete, watches the full recovered
  launch window, and fences hooks only from its original tmux identity.
- Synthetic initial turns retain provider working-status and terminal-failure
  tracking while suppressing only their prompt echo. URL dot-segment external
  keys are rejected before they could create an unreachable automation record.

### Security
- Automation working directories and provider flags use the existing remote
  launch boundaries; Claude automations cannot adopt an unrelated conversation
  with `--continue`. Exact stop refuses rebound tmux/session/channel identities,
  and synthetic initial prompts never receive artifact-upload grants.
- Browser-originated, simple-content-type, and non-loopback-Host automation
  requests are rejected before they can reach the local RCE lifecycle.

[1.5.0-rc.9]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.9

## [1.5.0-rc.8] — 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- `/codex-stop` now waits for either the normal `Stop` hook or Codex's idle
  input surface before reporting success. Confirmed hookless interrupts clear
  their persisted timer and Slack working status; unconfirmed interrupts keep
  tracking active and report a visible warning.
- Daemon startup now removes an orphaned Codex working status when persisted
  turn state points at a TUI that has already returned to idle.

[1.5.0-rc.8]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.8

## [1.5.0-rc.7] — 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- Long inline Slack responses now split Block Kit sections at nearby paragraph,
  newline, or word boundaries instead of cutting words at an arbitrary character.
  Oversized code fences remain independently valid and hard splits preserve
  Unicode surrogate pairs.

[1.5.0-rc.7]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.7

## [1.5.0-rc.6] — 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- Live Claude, Codex, and Pi working-status messages are re-anchored below
  newer channel messages, bridge output, artifact deliveries, and real topic
  changes. Status replacement is serialized per session and rolls back safely
  if Slack cannot remove the superseded copy.

[1.5.0-rc.6]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.6

## [1.5.0-rc.5] — 2026-08-20

### Fixed
- Managed Pi planners and independent reviewers now finish through isolated,
  typed, terminating submission tools instead of relying on prompt-only JSON
  prose. The bridge captures validated tool details, attempts one bounded
  no-tools repair when legacy/malformed output cannot be parsed, and includes a
  bounded diagnostic excerpt if both submissions fail.

[1.5.0-rc.5]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.5

## [1.5.0-rc.4] — 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- Claude login-expired and API-overloaded turns are now mirrored immediately
  even when Claude returns to idle without emitting its normal `Stop` hook.
  Detection reads only new transcript records, clears the live working status,
  and suppresses repeated identical failures for a bounded interval.

[1.5.0-rc.4]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.4

## [1.5.0-rc.3] — 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- Pi launch and resume commands now translate the bridge's securely validated
  inline `--model=`, `--thinking=`, and `--provider=` values into the separate
  argument form required by Pi 0.84.2, instead of exiting at startup with an
  unknown-options error.

[1.5.0-rc.3]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.3

## [1.5.0-rc.2] — 2026-08-19

### Added
- **Adaptive Pi orchestration.** Ordinary owner prompts now default to an
  isolated, tool-free, low-thinking complexity decision and are automatically
  promoted when planning, persistent goals, subagents, validation, or review
  would help. The native session persists `auto`, `always`, or `native` policy;
  `/pi-run direct <prompt>` bypasses routing once and `/pi-run <goal>` remains
  the force-managed path. Collaborator prompts remain native.
- **Crash-safe routing and Slack feedback.** A pending decision survives
  terminal/daemon restart without exposing artifact-upload capabilities to the
  classifier or daemon snapshots. Slack shows live assessment status and a
  durable promotion reason; interrupt/cancel and failure paths are explicit.
- **Managed Pi runs.** `/pi-run <goal>` adds a persistent bridge-owned
  planner → worker → independent-reviewer loop for complex local-model work.
  `/pi-run plan <goal>` pauses after the read-only plan for explicit approval.
- **Bounded long-running goals.** Managed state and step progress live in the
  native Pi session, survive terminal and daemon restarts, and continue until
  independent review passes or an explicit time, parent-turn, subagent, or
  review-cycle budget is reached.
- **Isolated Pi subagents.** The parent can invoke focused planner, scout,
  reviewer, and opt-in worker children. Children inherit the selected model and
  thinking level but never inherit the Slack bridge, upload grant, session,
  extensions, skills, themes, or project-resource approval.
- **Slack progress and control.** Plans, current phase/step/role, counters,
  review findings, failure notices, and completion appear in the session
  channel. Owner-only status, approve, pause, continue, and cancel actions are
  available under `/pi-run`.

### Safety
- Planning, scouting, and review children are read-only. Worker children are
  disabled under SAB `--safe`; the parent remains behind the existing Slack
  tool-approval gate.
- Managed execution does not widen Pi's ordinary filesystem or process
  privileges. Budgets prevent silent indefinite loops but are not a sandbox.

[1.5.0-rc.2]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.2

## [1.5.0-rc.1] — 2026-08-19

### Added
- **Native Pi provider.** `sab-pi` runs the ordinary Pi TUI in the shared
  Ghostty/tmux lifecycle and explicitly loads a bridge-owned native extension;
  ordinary Pi sessions and global Pi configuration remain untouched.
- **Complete `/pi-*` namespace.** New, model, thinking effort, flags, update,
  stop, status, usage, kill, help, and switch commands are provider-isolated.
  The canonical manifest adds them to the existing Slack app without new OAuth
  scopes or tokens.
- **Native Pi transport and telemetry.** The extension carries inbound Slack
  prompts, model-capable images, lifecycle/final text, live token/context
  counters, model catalogs, settings changes, and interrupts. Usage is stored as
  a content-free native event ledger; Pi session JSONL is never parsed.
- **Optional Pi safe mode.** SAB `--safe` relays every Pi tool call to Slack and
  fails closed on denial, timeout, identity mismatch, or bridge loss. Pi's
  separate project-resource trust prompt is also available remotely.
- **Three-provider handoff.** A channel can retain independent Claude, Codex,
  and Pi native legs while keeping exactly one active. Explicit target syntax
  covers every direction, and Pi uses the existing private handoff,
  instruction-alignment, validation, commit, queue, and rollback protocol.
- **Staged Pi installation.** `install-pi.sh` adds Pi without restarting the
  live daemon. Fresh installs accept `--provider pi` or `--provider all`;
  historical `--provider both` remains Claude+Codex for compatibility.

### Compatibility and safety
- Missing provider fields still mean Claude, and version-1 lineages receive a
  null Pi leg only when touched. Existing Claude/Codex command behavior,
  aliases, state paths, port, LaunchAgent, channels, and switch defaults remain
  unchanged.
- Pi project trust and tool approval are documented as distinct controls. Pi's
  default built-in tools are unrestricted; no misleading `--dsp`/`--yolo`
  alias is invented.
- Pi process, tmux, session, stream, permission, artifact, and provisional
  target claims are cross-checked before state or Slack destinations can be
  mutated.

[1.5.0-rc.1]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.5.0-rc.1

## [1.4.0-rc.6] — 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- Concurrent startup lifecycle hooks now share one single-flight Slack channel
  binding per native session, preventing duplicate private channels and split
  inbound/outbound routing.
- Daemon boot removes stale channel aliases that contradict a session's
  authoritative channel ID, repairing duplicate mappings without renaming or
  archiving Slack channels.

[1.4.0-rc.6]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc.6

## [1.4.0-rc.5] — 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- Codex target readiness now ignores trailing blank terminal rows. Tall Ghostty
  windows can render the complete idle UI near the top with empty space below;
  that ready state no longer waits until the transactional startup timeout.

[1.4.0-rc.5]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc.5

## [1.4.0-rc.4] — 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- Provisional provider targets now wait for the actual visible agent input
  surface instead of treating tmux creation as application readiness. This
  prevents private validation prompts from being pasted into startup or trust
  screens and silently lost.
- Local folder/hook trust remains explicit: the bridge reports the wait in
  Slack, sends no keys, and continues automatically after the operator approves
  the prompt in Ghostty.
- After validation input is submitted, the provisional provider must register
  a native hook session claim within 30 seconds. Missing hooks now produce a
  fast, visible rollback instead of an ambiguous five-minute wait.

[1.4.0-rc.4]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc.4

## [1.4.0-rc.3] — 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- Large instruction consolidations now ask the auxiliary provider for bounded
  document sections instead of a full unified diff. The bridge constructs and
  validates the Git patch deterministically, avoiding duplicated source text
  and long model-authored deletion hunks.
- Reconciliation runs in a private neutral directory so the repository's
  `CLAUDE.md` is not loaded a second time. Slack and bridge credentials are
  removed from the auxiliary process environment.
- The proposal ceiling defaults to ten minutes and can be bounded through
  `CCS_INSTRUCTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; Slack receives a progress notice every
  minute and a visible safe failure if generation still cannot complete.
- Long proposals now attach the complete patch for owner review instead of
  labelling a truncated preview as the full proposal.

[1.4.0-rc.3]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc.3

## [1.4.0-rc.2] — 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- Provider-switch confirmation buttons now use unique Slack Block Kit action
  identifiers, preventing `invalid_blocks` from silently discarding the
  preflight confirmation.
- A failed switch-preview delivery immediately rolls back its persisted
  preflight instead of blocking retries until the 30-minute expiry.
- Slash-command failures now post a durable channel notice, with the command's
  ephemeral response URL as a bounded fallback when channel posting fails.

[1.4.0-rc.2]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc.2

## [1.4.0-rc.1] — 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Transactional provider handoff.** `/cc-switch` hands an active Claude Code
  channel to Codex, and `/codex-switch` hands an active Codex channel to Claude
  Code. Each Slack channel preserves separate native provider conversations and
  keeps exactly one leg active.
- **Private structured handoffs.** The source produces a bounded SAB v1 summary;
  the target must complete a read-only readiness turn before the channel mapping
  commits. Handoff files are integrity checked, mode `0600`, and retained for
  two generations.
- **Reviewed instruction alignment.** Repository-root `AGENTS.md` and
  `CLAUDE.md` can be reconciled through a constrained unified-diff proposal.
  Hash, path, binary, symlink, mode, apply, and 32 KiB budget checks run before
  an owner-approved patch is left as uncommitted work.

### Safety
- Transition phases are synchronously journaled with atomic state writes. A
  daemon restart or target failure reaps the exact provisional tmux and restores
  the source mapping.
- Owner messages queue at channel scope during a switch and receive target-bound
  artifact grants only after commit. Collaborators cannot enqueue work during a
  transition, and source-session upload grants are revoked on commit.
- Stale and manually started standby hooks cannot create a second channel or
  race the active provider. Cleanup removes every native leg in an archived
  channel lineage.

### Compatibility
- Legacy sessions remain lazy, migration-free Claude records until their first
  switch. Existing configuration paths, channels, launchers, state mappings,
  HTTP port, and LaunchAgent identity remain unchanged.
- Apply the canonical Slack manifest to the same app once to register
  `/cc-switch` and `/codex-switch`; no new scopes, tokens, or second app are
  required.

[1.4.0-rc.1]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.4.0-rc.1

## [1.3.0] — 2026-08-15

### Released
- Promoted the exact RC.1 runtime after a production Slack request generated and
  returned `ana-dashboard-2026-08-15.pdf` (`application/pdf`, 355,972 bytes) in
  the existing `cc-project99-ana` channel through the grant-bound upload path.
- Confirmed the live rollout preserved existing sessions and tmux processes with
  exactly one Socket Mode daemon, while the installed bot reused its existing
  `files:write` grant without a manifest or OAuth change.

[1.3.0]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.3.0

## [1.3.0-rc.1] — 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Generated artifact delivery.** Authorized owner and per-channel collaborator
  prompts can ask Claude Code or Codex to return generated files through the new
  provider-neutral `sab-upload` helper and Slack's current `filesUploadV2` flow.
- Upload capabilities are opaque, one-use, two-hour grants bound to the Slack
  sender/message, provider, live process/tmux session, immutable channel, and
  canonical workspace. The daemon rejects replay, concurrency, traversal,
  symlink escape, non-regular files, more than ten files, or more than 100 MiB.

### Compatibility
- The existing Slack app already has `files:write`; no manifest update,
  reauthorization, token, command, event, configuration, state, channel, hook,
  provider launcher, or LaunchAgent migration is required. Rerunning the local
  installer adds `sab-upload` to `PATH`.

[1.3.0-rc.1]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc.1

## [1.2.0] — 2026-08-14

### Released
- Promoted RC.2 after production canaries confirmed live Codex token progress,
  `/codex-usage` reporting, and quiet topic synchronization against the existing
  Slack app and session.
- Audited all 22 managed channels after an unchanged daemon restart and found
  zero topic-change events. A live Codex turn displayed elapsed time plus total,
  output, and reasoning-token deltas.
- Confirmed the installer recovered from the observed transient launchd error 5
  on its bounded retry while keeping exactly one Socket Mode daemon connected.

[1.2.0]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.2.0

## [1.2.0-rc.2] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- The installer retries the transient macOS launchd bootout/bootstrap race up
  to three times with a bounded delay. The RC.1 production canary encountered
  error 5 once and recovered on the next bootstrap attempt.

[1.2.0-rc.2]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.2.0-rc.2

## [1.2.0-rc.1] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Codex usage reporting.** `/codex-usage`, `/codex-usage days [n]`, and
  `/codex-usage models` use `ccusage`'s provider adapter for session, project,
  daily, model, token, and cost reports.
- **Live Codex token status.** The edit-in-place working message now combines
  hook-derived elapsed time with bounded `ccusage` snapshots, showing per-turn
  total, output, and reasoning-token deltas as they become available.

### Fixed
- Topic synchronization reads the existing Slack topic after daemon startup and
  calls `conversations.setTopic` only when the desired value differs. Concurrent
  startup updates are serialized per channel, preventing restart-wide topic
  notifications.
- Claude usage queries now select `ccusage claude` explicitly, preventing newer
  unified `ccusage` output from mixing Codex totals into `/cc-usage`.

### Compatibility
- Existing Slack apps must apply `slack/app-manifest.json` to the same app once
  to register `/codex-usage`. No OAuth scopes, tokens, channels, configuration,
  state, hooks, launchers, or LaunchAgent identities change.

[1.2.0-rc.1]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.2.0-rc.1

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-14

### Released
- Promoted the RC.1 runtime after the production canary preserved the existing
  Codex session and Slack channel across the daemon roll. Post-roll Slack input
  reached the live session with exactly one Socket Mode daemon connected.
- Verified `sab-cc`, `sab-codex`, `ccs`, and `ccs-codex` against the installed
  Claude Code and Codex CLIs before promotion.

[1.1.0]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.1.0

## [1.1.0-rc.1] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Provider-neutral launcher names.** `sab-cc` launches Claude Code and
  `sab-codex` launches Codex. Daemon-created and resumed sessions use these
  canonical binaries directly.

### Compatibility
- `ccs` and `ccs-codex` are silent, argument-preserving aliases and remain
  supported throughout 1.x. `CCS_*`, `~/.config/ccs`, internal tmux names,
  Slack commands, hooks, state, tokens, and the LaunchAgent are unchanged.
- Existing installations need only rerun the provider installer once to add the
  `sab-*` symlinks to `PATH`; no Slack app or manifest update is required.

[1.1.0-rc.1]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.1.0-rc.1

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-14

### Released
- Renamed the project to **Slack Agent Bridge**, with Claude Code and Codex as
  first-class providers under their separate `/cc-*` and `/codex-*` commands.
- Added provider-selective installation, canonical agent/contributor guidance,
  migration and release runbooks, a single Slack manifest, expanded security
  documentation, compatibility tests, and Node 20/24 CI.
- Preserved existing commands, `CCS_*` configuration, state, install paths,
  control channels, and the historical LaunchAgent identity. Existing Slack
  apps need no new tokens, scopes, or replacement manifest for this release.
- Updated the production dependency tree to zero known audit vulnerabilities.
- Promoted the RC.2 runtime after a live Codex kill → Slack wake → Ghostty/tmux
  resume canary preserved its channel, dangerous-mode flag, model, and `xhigh`
  reasoning effort with exactly one daemon connected.

[1.0.0]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.0.0

## [1.0.0-rc.2] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- Dead-session permission prompts are pruned at boot and whenever a process is
  ended or restarted. Live Claude prompts remain restart-recoverable, while
  Codex's process-bound held responses still expire safely on daemon restart.

[1.0.0-rc.2]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.2

## [1.0.0-rc.1] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Provider-neutral project identity.** ClaudeSlackProxy is now Slack Agent
  Bridge, with Claude Code and Codex presented as first-class provider adapters.
- **Provider-selective installation.** Fresh setups may install Claude, Codex,
  or both; the old flagless installer remains Claude-only.
- **A documented compatibility contract.** `AGENTS.md`, the migration guide,
  and automated checks protect existing commands, paths, state, channels, and
  the live LaunchAgent across the rename.

### Changed
- The canonical Slack app manifest now lives at `slack/app-manifest.json` and
  carries provider-neutral metadata. The stale Claude-only YAML manifest was
  removed so there is one source of truth.
- Fresh installations and control channels use neutral names. Existing
  `~/.claudeslackproxy` checkouts and `#claude-code-bridge` channels are reused.
- The documented Node.js minimum is now 20, matching the Slack SDK runtime
  requirement instead of the former, inaccurate Node 18 declaration.

### Compatibility
- `/cc-*`, `/codex-*`, `ccs*`, `CCS_*`, `~/.config/ccs`, stored sessions, and
  `si.sergej.claudeslackproxy` remain unchanged. No new Slack app, token, or
  OAuth scope is required.

### Security
- Updated the MCP SDK, usage tooling, and transitive dependencies; the release
  dependency tree audits with no known vulnerabilities.
- The historical Slack spike now requires an explicit test user instead of
  selecting a workspace member, and it no longer carries a second npm lockfile.

[1.0.0-rc.1]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/SlackAgentBridge/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1

## [0.2.28] — 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **Slack-triggered Codex resurrection no longer waits for local typing.** An
  idle `codex resume` can defer `SessionStart`, while the bridge previously
  waited for that hook before pasting the queued wake message. The first Slack
  message is now supplied as Codex's optional resume prompt, which starts the
  turn immediately; subsequent queued messages retain the existing hook-driven
  flush order.

[0.2.28]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.28

## [0.2.27] — 2026-08-14

### Changed
- **Codex now mirrors Claude's remote-spawn default.** Flagless `/codex-new`
  sessions and resumes without captured launch flags use Codex's canonical
  `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`. The documented `--yolo` alias
  is accepted in Slack commands and normalized to the canonical flag. Explicit
  flags and `CCS_CODEX_NEW_FLAGS` / `CCS_CODEX_RESUME_FLAGS` still override the
  default.
- **Clarified browser capability.** Codex `--search` enables live web search; it
  is not a counterpart to Claude's `--chrome`. Browser automation still needs
  a separately configured MCP server or plugin.

[0.2.27]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.27

## [0.2.26] — 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Opt-in Codex CLI terminal sessions.** `ccs-codex` and
  `/codex-new <folder>` reuse the existing private-channel, tmux,
  Ghostty, attachment, resurrection, and Slack command infrastructure. Codex
  lifecycle hooks mirror terminal prompts and stable final assistant text;
  synchronous permission hooks relay approve/deny decisions through Slack.
- **Provider-aware commands and state.** Missing provider fields continue to
  mean Claude, so existing state needs no migration. Status/health, model,
  reasoning effort, flags, update, interrupt, spawn API, and project picker now
  dispatch to the active provider.
- **Explicit Slack command namespaces.** `/cc-*` is Claude-only and the parallel
  `/codex-*` commands are Codex-only. Bridge-wide ownership, health, and cleanup
  remain singular under `/cc-*`; Claude usage and account switching remain
  Claude-only. Existing Slack apps must apply the updated manifest once to
  register the new command names; scopes and tokens are unchanged.
- **Separate Codex activation.** `install-codex.sh` idempotently merges user
  hooks and links the launcher without changing Claude settings or restarting
  the daemon. Codex `/hooks` trust remains explicit.

### Fixed
- **Codex channel topics now include reasoning effort.** Codex lifecycle hooks
  expose the model but not effort, so the bridge resolves effort from the
  session's launch override and layered Codex configuration. Existing live
  channels are hydrated safely on daemon restart; Codex transcript JSONL
  remains outside the runtime integration.

### Security
- Codex remote-spawn flags use a narrow provider-specific allowlist; arbitrary
  config overrides, feature toggles, profiles, extra writable directories, and
  hook-trust bypass are rejected.
- Stale hooks from a process being replaced can no longer roll back persisted
  flags/account/model settings or mark the new process dormant.

[0.2.26]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.26

## [0.2.25] — 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **Window titles stopped mirroring the channel topic.** Ghostty's `title`
  config *pins* a window's title and ignores the escape sequences tmux uses, so
  passing `--title` at spawn silently disabled topic mirroring (windows showed
  the working directory instead). The spawner no longer sets a title at all —
  tmux owns it, and `updateTopic` keeps it in sync with Slack.
- **A windowless bridge instance silently swallowed every window request.** In
  single-icon mode, File → New Window on an instance with zero windows
  "succeeds" (AppleScript even returns the menu item) while opening nothing, so
  sessions stayed windowless with no error. Such instances are now detected and
  reaped, and the caller relaunches an instance instead.

### Known limitation
- **Single-icon mode (`CCS_GHOSTTY_SINGLE=1`) no longer works reliably.**
  Creating a window in a *running* Ghostty needs UI scripting (macOS has no
  Ghostty IPC — `+new-window` is Linux-only), and current Ghostty ignores both
  the File → New Window menu click and ⌘N even with the app frontmost, the menu
  item enabled, and Accessibility granted. It can open the first window (via
  instance launch) and nothing after, so a machine restart degrades it to one
  instance per session. Prefer `CCS_GHOSTTY_HIDDEN=1` (accessory windows, no
  Dock icons at all) or the default one-icon-per-session.

[0.2.25]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.25

## [0.2.24] — 2026-08-13

### Added
- **`/cc-flags` — change a session's launch flags without losing it.** Shows the
  current flags with no argument; `/cc-flags --dsp --chrome` sets them, restarts
  the session and resumes the same conversation (Claude Code reads these at
  startup, so a restart is unavoidable — it's the same dance as `/cc-account`).
  Validated against the existing allowlist, deduped, and persisted so resumes
  keep them. Requires reinstalling the app manifest.
- **`/cc-new` no longer spawns flagless sessions.** With no flags given it used
  to launch a bare `claude` — no `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, so the session
  prompted for every tool and had no way to be corrected from Slack. It now
  applies a configurable default (`CCS_NEW_FLAGS`, default
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions`); explicit flags still replace it entirely.
  The project picker uses the same default.

[0.2.24]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.24

## [0.2.23] — 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Long-context models are selectable.** `Opus 5` and `Opus 5 (1M context)` are
  distinct model ids (`claude-opus-5` vs `claude-opus-5[1m]`), and Claude Code's
  family alias always resolves to the standard one — so the 1M variant was
  unreachable from Slack, and invisible in `/cc-model`'s listing because the
  enumerator's pattern stopped at word characters. Bracketed ids are now
  discovered and listed, and **a bare family alias selects the long-context
  variant when the build has one** (`/cc-model opus` → `claude-opus-5[1m]`),
  since bridged sessions run long. Pass a full id for the standard window. The
  rule is general: any family that gains a `[1m]` sibling picks it up.

### Fixed
- **Windows restored after a reboot became plain shells while their sessions ran
  headless.** macOS reopens the bridge's Ghostty windows with an empty spool, so
  the dispatcher fell through to a login shell and every session looked dead in
  Slack. It now **adopts a live bridged session that has no window** instead.
- **Window requests reported success even when no window appeared.** The scripted
  File → New Window click can silently do nothing (UI scripting), leaving
  sessions windowless with no error anywhere. The daemon now verifies the
  terminal actually attached and falls back to a dedicated window otherwise.

[0.2.23]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.23

## [0.2.22] — 2026-08-11

### Added
- **Per-session Claude subscriptions.** A session can run under a named Claude
  account, so collaborative work bills to whoever owns that session instead of
  everyone sharing one subscription. Manage accounts on the Mac with
  **`ccs-account`** (`add` mints a token via `claude setup-token` in a throwaway
  config dir, so the sign-in never disturbs the machine's own login; `set` takes
  a token minted elsewhere; `list` masks them). Bind and switch from Slack with
  **`/cc-account [name | default]`** — switching restarts the session and
  resumes the same conversation. `/cc-new` and the spawn API accept
  `--account <name>` / `{account}`, and a session's binding survives resume.
  Requires reinstalling the app manifest to register the new slash command.

  **Secrets never travel where they could leak**: tokens live only in
  `~/.config/ccs/accounts` (0600) and are resolved inside `ccs` at launch — the
  command line carries just the account *name*, since `ps` shows every
  process's argv to every user on the machine. Names are strictly validated
  (`[A-Za-z0-9_-]`) before they reach a shell, and tokens never enter
  `state.json`, the daemon log, channel topics, or window titles.

### Fixed
- **A stray hook could hijack a live session and orphan its channel.** The
  identity-refresh path (which legitimately rebrands a record when `/clear`
  gives the same process a new session id) matched purely on the resolved pid,
  so *any* hook whose ppid happened to resolve to a running session's claude
  took that session's record and channel with it. The channel then had no owner,
  the session went silent, and the next hook minted a **duplicate channel** for
  a terminal that already had one. Takeover now requires the payload's own
  transcript to belong to the new session id **and** the same terminal;
  mismatches are logged and ignored.
- **Lost bindings reclaim their channel instead of creating a duplicate.** The
  daemon remembers which terminal owns each channel, so a session whose binding
  disappeared (state edited underneath it, a botched migration, a manual repair)
  re-attaches to its existing channel and posts "Reconnected" rather than
  starting a fresh one.

[0.2.22]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.22

## [0.2.21] — 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- **Plan-approval dialogs reach Slack.** Claude Code's "ready to execute —
  proceed?" dialog renders *after* the turn's Stop hook, when the live-status
  poller has already shut down — so it was never relayed and the session looked
  disconnected. The daemon now runs a one-shot form check shortly after every
  finalize, re-adopts sessions that are waiting at a question form on restart,
  and relays the **plan file itself** (the dialog names it) into the channel
  alongside the buttons. Free-text replies route through "Tell Claude what to
  change" when a plan dialog is open.

[0.2.21]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.21

## [0.2.20] — 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- **Daemon spawns silently produced nothing after Claude Code's updater removed
  its old Homebrew shim.** `ccs` resolved `claude` via PATH; the daemon's PATH
  lacks `~/.local/bin` (the native install's home), so from Aug 8 every
  daemon-launched session died at exec ("claude: not found") within
  milliseconds — no channel, no window, no error. `ccs` now falls back to
  `~/.local/bin` when `claude` isn't on PATH, and the installer's LaunchAgent
  PATH includes it.
- **Detached spawns are now babysat.** The daemon verifies claude reaches its
  prompt before requesting the window (no more mid-boot attach races), captures
  the dying session's last screen into the log when a boot fails (forensics),
  retries once, and — crucially — **fails loudly** through `/spawn`/`ccs-spawn`
  instead of pretending success, so calling scripts can fall back.

[0.2.20]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.20

## [0.2.19] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- **Script-facing spawn API.** `POST /spawn {cwd, flags}` on the daemon's
  localhost port launches a bridged session with flag validation, the
  single-icon window path, and a clean environment — external tooling (e.g.
  worktree scripts) no longer needs its own `open -na Ghostty`, which bypassed
  window grouping and could leak environment. `POST /window {tmux, title}`
  adopts an existing tmux session's viewport under the single icon. New
  `ccs-spawn <dir> [flags...]` CLI wraps `/spawn` and exits non-zero when the
  daemon is unreachable so callers can fall back.

[0.2.19]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.19

## [0.2.18] — 2026-08-04

### Added
- **Single-icon mode (`CCS_GHOSTTY_SINGLE=1`)** — all bridge terminals under
  ONE Ghostty Dock icon, right-click listing every session window by name. A
  dedicated bridge instance runs the new `ccs-window` dispatcher as its
  `command`: every new window pops the next pending session from a spool and
  attaches to its tmux. The daemon creates sessions detached, then requests a
  window — the first via launching the instance, later ones via a scripted
  File → New Window click (requires a one-time Accessibility grant for the
  daemon's `node`; without it, spawns fall back to today's per-instance windows
  and nothing breaks). Windows the user opens manually (Cmd+N) become plain
  shells when nothing is pending.
- **Window titles mirror the channel topic.** Every session window is titled
  exactly like its Slack channel topic — `folder · branch · model · effort` —
  and updates whenever the topic does, so the Dock's window list reads the same
  as your Slack sidebar.

[0.2.18]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.18

## [0.2.17] — 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **Cross-session message routing corruption.** A session spawned from a shell
  that inherited another session's `CCS_TMUX` (env leaks through `open` /
  Ghostty windows / scripts run inside bridged sessions) registered claiming
  the other session's tmux — so its channel's Slack messages were pasted into
  the wrong terminal, and mirrored back into the wrong channel. Three layers:
  `ccs` now unsets any inherited `CCS_TMUX` (and hardens PATH so the tmux
  self-wrap can't silently degrade in bare login shells); `ghosttySpawn` strips
  all `CCS_*` variables from the environment handed to `open`; and the daemon
  now **validates every tmux claim** — a session's tmux name is only accepted
  if the claiming claude process actually descends from one of that tmux
  session's panes (poisoned stored claims heal to null, falling back to
  channel-plugin injection).
- **Inherited Claude identity no longer produces phantom "child sessions."**
  The same env leak could carry `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` /
  `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` / `CLAUDE_PID` into a new `ccs` launch, making the
  new claude believe it was a child of another session — it then wrote **no
  transcript of its own**, silently breaking response mirroring and resume.
  `ccs` now sheds all inherited Claude-identity variables before exec, and the
  daemon's spawner strips `CLAUDE*`/`ANTHROPIC_*`/`CCS_*` from the environment
  it hands `open`.

[0.2.17]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.17

## [0.2.16] — 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Optional dockless terminals.** Each session's window is its own Ghostty
  instance (macOS Ghostty has no IPC to open windows in a running instance), so
  every session normally adds a Dock icon. Set `CCS_GHOSTTY_HIDDEN=1` in
  `~/.config/ccs/env` to spawn them in accessory mode instead: windows stay
  fully visible and clickable but add no Dock icon or Cmd-Tab entry. Default
  remains one Dock icon per session.

### Fixed
- **Launching `ccs` inside an existing tmux session now bridges fully.** The
  self-wrapping branch sets `CCS_TMUX`, but running `ccs` from within tmux
  skipped the wrap and left it empty — the channel got created, yet
  Slack→terminal injection, `/cc-stop`, and the live-status poller silently
  targeted nothing. `ccs` now derives the name from the surrounding tmux
  session (`tmux display-message -p '#S'`) when unset.

[0.2.16]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.16

## [0.2.15] — 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **Claude Code's internal background workers no longer create ghost channels.**
  Claude Code 2.1.220+ spawns internal helper processes — a transient per-user
  daemon, warm "spare" sessions, and background agents — which inherit
  `CCS_BRIDGE` and the global hooks from their parent session. Their SessionStart
  hooks made the bridge register them as real sessions and create channels
  (e.g. `#code-<stamp>`) out of nowhere. New registrations are now gated on the
  resolved process's command line: anything carrying internal-worker markers
  (`--agent`, `bg-pty-host`, `bg-spare`, `daemon run`, `--session-id`) is
  ignored. Existing bridged sessions are unaffected.

[0.2.15]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.15

## [0.2.14] — 2026-07-28

One release covering two staged changes (0.2.13 was never tagged separately).

### Added
- **Interactive question forms are relayed to Slack.** Claude Code can pause a
  turn on a numbered-options question (sometimes a multi-tab wizard ending in a
  review/Submit screen); previously the bridge showed nothing — the session just
  looked frozen, and replies typed in Slack were eaten by the open form. The
  live-status poller now detects an open form in the terminal, mirrors it to the
  channel as **buttons** (question + options, updating one message in place as
  the wizard advances), and maps answers back to keystrokes. Reply with a bare
  number instead of tapping if you prefer; free-text replies route through the
  form's "Type something" / "Chat about this" option when it offers one. A form
  waiting for input also no longer trips the poller's turn-end fallback.

### Fixed
- **Adopting an existing session no longer risks replaying its entire history
  into Slack.** A session the daemon had never seen (e.g. resuming a pre-bridge
  conversation into a new channel) registered with a transcript offset of 0, so
  the first completed turn would have mirrored the whole historical transcript
  into the channel as one giant dump. Registration now anchors to the
  transcript's current end — only activity from adoption onward is mirrored.
  Brand-new sessions are unaffected (their transcript starts empty).

[0.2.14]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.14

## [0.2.12] — 2026-07-25

### Added
- **`/cc-usage` — token & cost reporting**, powered by
  [ccusage](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage) (bundled as a dependency, no
  separate install). In a session channel it reports that **project**: the
  current session's tokens/cost, the project total across all its sessions, and
  the models used. In the control channel (or any unmapped channel) it reports
  the **aggregate**: the last 7 days day by day, this month, and all time.
  Project scoping works by matching ccusage's per-session rows against the
  `.jsonl` transcripts in the project's `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/` directory.
  Requires reinstalling the app manifest to register the new slash command.
- **`/cc-usage days [n]`** — a per-day sheet (up to 14 days) with models used,
  input/output tokens, cache write/read, total, and cost, plus a Σ row.
  **`/cc-usage models`** — all-time per-model breakdown (in/out/cache w/r/cost).
- **`/cc-usage limits` — your real plan limits, live.** Claude Code's statusline
  feed carries the account rate-limit state, so the daemon now mirrors what
  claude.ai/settings/usage shows: current 5-hour session usage % and reset time,
  weekly all-models % and reset (any additional buckets appear automatically).
  A one-line limits footer also rides on the other usage views when fresh data
  is available. No scraping, no extra auth — it's already in the feed.

[0.2.12]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.12

## [0.2.11] — 2026-07-25

### Added
- **Near-one-click install.** `curl -fsSL …/install.sh | bash` now clones the
  repo itself, opens Slack's app-creation page **pre-filled with the manifest**
  (a shareable `new_app=1&manifest_yaml=` deep link — no copy-pasting JSON),
  validates both pasted tokens live (`auth.test` + `apps.connections.open`, so
  typos fail immediately), and derives the team ID automatically.
- **`/cc-claim` — ownership without hunting for your member ID.** Fresh installs
  start unclaimed; the first person to run `/cc-claim` becomes the owner
  (persisted to `~/.config/ccs/env`, invited to the control channel). Until
  claimed the daemon trusts nobody and does nothing else. `SLACK_USER_ID` no
  longer needs to be looked up by hand.

Install friction drops to: one command, ~4 clicks in Slack, two token pastes,
one `/cc-claim`. A public "Add to Slack" app is deliberately not offered:
Socket Mode delivers an app's events over the app-level token — one shared
stream per app (10-connection cap) — so a shared public app would route every
workspace's events to every user's local daemon. Per-user apps keep each
user's tokens and traffic on their own machine.

[0.2.11]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.11

## [0.2.10] — 2026-07-25

### Added
- **Auto-update.** The daemon checks GitHub at startup and every 6 hours; when a
  new release lands it fast-forwards its git clone, runs `npm ci --omit=dev` if
  `package.json` changed, and restarts itself via launchd — sessions keep
  running and are re-adopted, and the control channel gets a "Bridge updated
  vX → vY" note. Safety guards: never touches a checkout with local changes or
  local commits (dev machines), only fast-forwards, waits for running turns to
  finish (up to 10 min) before restarting, and skips silently when offline.
  Opt out with `CCS_AUTO_UPDATE=0` in `~/.config/ccs/env`.

[0.2.10]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.10

## [0.2.9] — 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- **Resurrects and `/cc-new` can no longer wedge silently when Ghostty is in a
  bad state.** Correcting 0.2.8's diagnosis: Ghostty 1.3.1 runs one process per
  window (not single-instance); an instance whose window failed to initialize
  lingers windowless, and enough of those make every subsequent window fail —
  the bridge then re-posted "Waking…" forever while nothing appeared, until
  Ghostty was quit manually. Three defenses, now safe because closing a window
  no longer kills sessions via tmux hooks: spawned instances self-quit when
  their window closes (`--quit-after-last-window-closed=true` is back); a
  reaper kills windowless instances, but only ones **older than 60s**, making
  0.2.8's fatal init-race (reaping a spawn still materializing) impossible; and
  every spawn is now **verified** — if the terminal doesn't materialize, the
  daemon kills the failed attempt, reaps, retries once, and otherwise reports
  the wedge honestly instead of spamming "Waking…".
- **Messages during a wake no longer stack extra terminals.** A resurrect in
  flight now blocks duplicate spawns (and duplicate "Waking…" posts) until the
  session is actually up; queued messages flush as before.

[0.2.9]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.9

## [0.2.8] — 2026-07-24

One batch release for today's run of features and fixes (staged internally as
0.2.5–0.2.8; only `v0.2.8` is tagged).

### Added
- **`/cc-update`** — update Claude Code and restart the current session with its
  original launch flags, resuming the same conversation. It stops the session,
  runs `claude update`, then relaunches through the resume path — so a session
  picks up a new CLI build (and newly released models) without losing context.
  Needs the app manifest reinstalled to register the new slash command.
- **`/cc-model` lists available models with real versions.** With no argument it
  now shows each alias, its display name, and its full model id (e.g. `opus` →
  Opus 5 → `claude-opus-5`), enumerated from the installed `claude` binary so the
  list stays correct across updates — nothing hardcoded.

### Fixed
- **`/cc-effort` and `/cc-model` now answer Claude Code's confirmation prompt.**
  Changing effort or model invalidates the prompt cache, so Claude Code asks
  "Change effort level? Yes / No" — which the daemon left hanging. The first
  `/cc-effort max` therefore did nothing (the channel topic stayed `low`), and only
  a second call — whose stray Enter confirmed the first dialog — took effect. The
  daemon now detects the dialog and confirms the highlighted "Yes," so a single
  call applies.
- **Effort is preserved across a resume.** `/effort` is per-session in Claude Code
  and resets to the default (low) on `--resume`. The daemon now remembers a
  session's effort (from the statusline / `/cc-effort`) and re-applies it as an
  `--effort` launch flag when resuming, so a restarted session keeps its effort.
- **A session whose working directory drifted into a subfolder can resume again.**
  `--resume` is scoped to the launch dir's project slug, but the daemon's recorded
  cwd follows the statusline — so if claude `cd`'d into a subdirectory mid-session,
  resuming looked for the transcript under the wrong slug, found nothing, and the
  session died instantly on every wake (`Waking up…` → `Session ended`). The daemon
  now re-anchors a resume to the directory that actually holds the transcript.
- **Resurrecting or spawning a session no longer kills every other session — and
  closing a terminal still ends its session.** Ghostty 1.3.1 runs single-instance
  on macOS: opening any window (every resurrect / `/cc-new` / `/cc-update`) briefly
  detaches every *other* window's tmux client for a fraction of a second before it
  re-attaches. The 0.2.1 `client-detached → kill-session` hook fired on that
  instantaneous blip — killing a session, whose window then closed and blipped the
  rest — a chain reaction that wiped out all live sessions on any spawn. The tmux
  hook is gone; instead the daemon watches client attachment and ends a session
  only after its window has stayed gone for a grace period (8s), well past any
  transient blip. So genuinely closing a terminal still terminates the session
  (write to resume), while a spawn leaves every other window untouched. Also
  reverted the 0.2.3 `--quit-after-last-window-closed` flag and the Ghostty process
  reaper, which assumed the old multi-instance model. The daemon strips the old
  hook from already-running sessions on boot.
- **A finished turn's response can no longer be silently lost.** Response
  mirroring relied solely on the Stop hook; if that hook was missed — across a
  daemon restart mid-turn, or on a very long auto-compacted turn — the final
  response landed in the terminal but never in Slack. The live-status poller now
  detects turn-end (the spinner disappearing) and finalizes as a fallback,
  mirroring the response and clearing status. It is idempotent with the Stop hook
  (the read offset guards against a double post).
- **A stranded transcript read-offset now self-heals on restart.** The offset is
  persisted with a debounced write that a hard restart (`kickstart -k` sends
  SIGKILL) could drop, leaving mirroring stuck behind and silently mirroring
  nothing. On boot, idle live sessions re-anchor their offset to the transcript's
  end; sessions mid-turn keep their offset and resume the poller (which will
  finalize them via the fallback above).

[0.2.8]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.8

## [0.2.4] — 2026-07-24

### Added
- **Collaborators — invite teammates into a session.** A per-channel whitelist
  lets you allow specific Slack users to send prompts to the session behind that
  channel. Manage it from `/cc-status` in a session channel: a user-picker adds a
  collaborator, a Remove button revokes them, and the current list is shown. A
  collaborator's prompt is injected labelled `[Slack collaborator <name>]`, so
  the transcript records who said what. Collaborators can send prompts only — not
  permission verdicts, `/cc-*` commands, or session resurrection — and only into a
  live session; all owner-only actions stay owner-only. The whitelist persists
  across daemon restarts. No Slack app changes required (uses the existing
  `users:read` scope and interactive components).

### Fixed
- **Live status survives a daemon restart.** The status poller and each status
  message's reference lived only in memory, so restarting the daemon mid-turn
  froze that turn's Slack status — it could no longer be updated, nor cleared
  when the turn ended. On boot the daemon now re-adopts any session still showing
  a spinner (resuming the poller on the existing status message, in place) and
  clears stale status for turns that ended while it was down.

[0.2.4]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.4

## [0.2.3] — 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **`/cc-new` (and resume) could fail with Ghostty's "terminal failed to
  initialize."** Each session opens its own Ghostty instance via
  `open -na Ghostty.app`. With Ghostty's default `quit-after-last-window-closed=false`,
  a terminated session left a *windowless* instance running, and enough of these
  eventually starved a fresh spawn of a GPU surface — the new window failed to
  initialize (and, having no surface, showed a neighboring window's title).
  Spawned instances now quit when their window closes
  (`--quit-after-last-window-closed=true`), and the daemon reaps any
  dead-session Ghostty instances before each spawn.

[0.2.3]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.3

## [0.2.2] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **Resume a session whose folder was deleted** (e.g. a removed git worktree)
  instead of failing silently. Claude Code scopes `--resume` to the folder's
  project and the spawn did `cd <folder>` first, so a missing folder made the
  window close instantly with the message lost. The transcript survives in
  `~/.claude/projects`, so the daemon now recreates the folder empty at its
  original path and resumes there (with a warning). The conversation is
  preserved; files from the deleted folder are not.

[0.2.2]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.2

## [0.2.1] — 2026-07-22

Terminal-lifecycle correctness fixes.

### Fixed
- **Closing a session's window now terminates it.** `ccs` wraps sessions in
  tmux, which used to keep `claude` running headless after the window closed. A
  `client-detached` tmux hook now runs `kill-session` on close, so the session
  genuinely ends — the channel posts "session ended," and writing to it resumes
  in a fresh terminal.
- **Resume preserves launch flags.** A resumed session dropped its original
  flags (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--chrome`, `--model`, …) and ran in
  default permission mode, prompting for every tool. `ccs` now reports its flags
  to the daemon, which replays them on resume. Sessions launched before this fix
  fall back to `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (override via `CCS_RESUME_FLAGS`).

[0.2.1]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.1

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-22

Native Slack slash commands, real-time status, and a reactive channel topic.

### Added
- **Native `/cc-*` slash commands** with command autocomplete, replacing the
  `./`-prefixed messages: `/cc-model`, `/cc-effort`, `/cc-new`, `/cc-status`,
  `/cc-health`, `/cc-stop`, `/cc-kill`, `/cc-cleanup`, `/cc-help`.
- `/cc-new` posts a project picker (dropdown of `CCS_CODE_DIR`); `/cc-model` and
  `/cc-effort` show the current value with no argument or set it with one.
- `/cc-status` in a session channel shows folder, branch, live git status,
  model, and effort; in the control channel it lists all sessions.
- **Live real-time status**: while a turn runs, the terminal's spinner (verb +
  elapsed + tokens) mirrors into an edit-in-place Slack message and clears when
  the turn ends.
- **Interrupt** a running turn from Slack (`/cc-stop`, via tmux Escape).
- **Reactive channel topic** — `folder · branch · model · effort`, updated as
  the session changes (deduped so Slack is only called on a real change).
- Statusline integration: `hooks/statusline.sh` forwards Claude Code's
  documented status JSON (model, effort, tokens, cost) to the daemon.

### Fixed
- Critical: the daemon crash-looped when a timer posted to an archived channel
  (unhandled rejection). Added global crash guards so no single Slack API error
  can take the daemon down.
- System task-notifications were mirrored as fake "You typed" messages; filtered.
- `loadEnv` merges the config env and repo `.env` so a partial config file no
  longer masks tokens.

### Removed
- The `./`-prefixed commands, superseded by the native `/cc-*` slash commands.
  Typing `./model` (etc.) now returns a one-line hint pointing to `/cc-model`.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/SergioTCG/ClaudeSlackProxy/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-21

First public release.

### Added
- Channel-per-session bridge between Slack and local Claude Code sessions.
- Bidirectional mirroring: terminal prompts, Claude's responses, live tool
  status, and markdown → Slack with native table blocks.
- Slack → session injection (full text via tmux paste); dormant sessions are
  resurrected in a Ghostty window on the next message.
- Remote session spawning (`./new`) restricted to `$HOME` and an allowlist of
  flags.
- Permission relay — Approve/Deny from Slack (buttons or `yes/no <id>`) for
  sessions not running `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
- File and image attachments from Slack, downloaded and read by Claude.
- Mid-turn narrative: prose and tool activity appear as the turn unfolds.
- Long responses upload as a `response.md` file; code fences survive the trip
  to Slack.
- Commands: `./status`, `./health`, `./kill`, `./cleanup`, `./model`,
  `./effort`, `./new`, `./help`.
- launchd daemon over Slack Socket Mode (outbound-only); auto-dismissed
  research-preview consent dialogs.
- `install.sh` installer and `~/.config/ccs` configuration.
